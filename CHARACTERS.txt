# The Shattered Crown - Character List

## MAIN CHARACTERS

### Prince Kaelith Starweaver
**Age:** 23  
**Role:** Protagonist  
**Description:** The crown prince of the Crystallumina kingdom, driven by an obsessive need to master crystal manipulation and become the world's greatest crystal artisan. Tall and lean with silver-streaked dark hair (a mark of his royal bloodline), piercing blue eyes that glow when he channels crystal energy, and hands scarred from years of intensive crystal work. Born with moderate natural talent but burning ambition that makes him vulnerable to the Lathe of Light's corruption. His pride and need for recognition blind him to his duties as a future ruler, creating the central conflict of his character arc.

### Zara Brightforge
**Age:** 21  
**Role:** Love Interest/Secondary Protagonist  
**Description:** A crystal-singer from the lower districts with extraordinary natural talent that rivals enhanced abilities. Auburn hair that seems to catch fire when she channels crystal energy, green eyes that flash with defiance, and calloused hands from working in the crystal mines before discovering her gift. Fierce, independent, and deeply committed to protecting her people. She sees through pretense and values substance over status. Her raw power comes from emotional connection to crystals rather than technical mastery, making her the perfect foil to Kaelith's artificial enhancement.

### Lord Malachar Starweaver
**Age:** 45  
**Role:** Primary Antagonist  
**Description:** Kaelith's uncle and the king's younger brother, passed over for succession due to his cruel ambitions. Tall and imposing with prematurely gray hair and cold amber eyes, he's spent years building his own network of crystal users through fear and manipulation. Unlike his nephew, he has no interest in becoming the greatest artisan - he wants raw political power and views the volcanic crisis as an opportunity to seize the throne. Commands a disciplined team of crystal warriors who work in brutal coordination.

## SUPPORTING CHARACTERS

### Master Elyrian (The Mentor)
**Age:** 67  
**Role:** Kaelith's Mentor/Moral Compass  
**Description:** The former royal crystal master who taught Kaelith the fundamentals before his pride took over. Elderly but spry, with white hair and gentle brown eyes that have seen too much. He recognizes the signs of the Lathe's corruption but lacks the power to stop it directly. Represents the old ways of crystal mastery through harmony and patience rather than force and ambition.

### Captain Thorne Ironvein
**Age:** 34  
**Role:** Royal Guard Captain/Ally  
**Description:** The captain of the royal guard who remains loyal to Kaelith despite his growing arrogance. A former crystal miner who earned his position through merit rather than birth. Stocky and strong with bronze skin and steady gray eyes, he serves as a bridge between the noble and common perspectives. His practical nature often clashes with Kaelith's grandiose plans.

### Kira Moonwhisper
**Age:** 19  
**Role:** Zara's Closest Friend/Crystal-Singer Network  
**Description:** Zara's best friend and fellow crystal-singer who helps organize the underground network of common crystal users. Small and quick with silver-blonde hair and bright violet eyes, she specializes in communication crystals that allow the network to coordinate. Her bubbly personality hides a sharp strategic mind and unwavering loyalty to Zara.

### Councilor Aldric Goldmantle
**Age:** 52  
**Role:** Court Politician/False Ally  
**Description:** A smooth-talking court politician who initially appears to support Kaelith but secretly feeds information to Malachar. Impeccably dressed with dark hair and calculating green eyes, he represents the corrupted nobility that values power over responsibility. His betrayal serves as a wake-up call about the consequences of Kaelith's arrogance.

### Daven Stormcaller
**Age:** 26  
**Role:** Malachar's Lieutenant/Dark Reflection  
**Description:** Malachar's most trusted crystal warrior, a dark reflection of what Kaelith could become if fully corrupted. Lean and dangerous with black hair and silver eyes, he wields crystal magic like a weapon rather than an art. His cold efficiency and complete loyalty to Malachar represent the endpoint of choosing power over connection.

### Old Henrik
**Age:** 74  
**Role:** Village Elder/Wisdom Figure  
**Description:** An elderly villager who lives near Mount Pyreth and first notices the seismic changes. Weathered and wise with a thick gray beard and kind hazel eyes, he represents the common people whose lives hang in the balance. His simple wisdom often cuts through complex problems, serving as a reminder of what truly matters.

### Lyra Crystalborn
**Age:** 29  
**Role:** Former Friend/Cautionary Tale  
**Description:** A former friend of Kaelith who was once considered for marriage before his corruption began. Elegant and refined with blonde hair and blue eyes, she now keeps her distance after experiencing his growing cruelty firsthand. Her rejection serves as an early warning sign of how his behavior affects those who once cared for him.

## MINOR CHARACTERS

### The Crystal-Singer Network
**Role:** Zara's Underground Organization  
**Description:** A diverse group of common folk with natural crystal abilities who have been secretly organizing to protect their communities. They include miners, artisans, street performers, and laborers who've learned to use their gifts for practical rather than showy purposes.

### The Royal Court
**Role:** Political Backdrop  
**Description:** Various nobles, advisors, and courtiers who represent the political establishment that Kaelith is meant to lead. Their growing unease with his behavior reflects the kingdom's instability.

### Malachar's Crystal Warriors
**Role:** Antagonist Forces  
**Description:** A disciplined team of crystal users trained for combat rather than artistry. They work in brutal coordination and represent the militarization of crystal magic for conquest rather than creation.

### The Common People
**Role:** Stakes/Motivation  
**Description:** The villagers, farmers, miners, and artisans whose lives depend on the protagonists' success. They serve as a reminder of who truly matters and what the characters are fighting to protect.
