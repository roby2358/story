# Chapter 4: Tremors in the Deep

The palace felt different in the days following the demonstration. Servants who had once met Kaelith's gaze with respectful warmth now looked away quickly, their expressions carefully neutral. Courtiers who had previously sought his attention found urgent business elsewhere when he approached. Even the crystals themselves seemed to dim in his presence, their usual eager responsiveness replaced by a reluctant compliance that left him frustrated and increasingly bitter.

"Perhaps," Master Elyrian had suggested during their increasingly tense lessons, "this would be an opportune time to reflect on the nature of harmony versus dominance."

Kaelith had dismissed him curtly, claiming he had more pressing matters to attend to. The truth was, he couldn't bear the disappointment in his mentor's eyes, couldn't stand the gentle questions about where his new power had come from and whether he truly understood its source.

*He's jealous,* the voice whispered as Kaelith paced his chambers on the third evening after the disaster. *They're all jealous. They want to see you fail because your success makes them look small.*

The prince paused before his window, looking out over the kingdom he would one day rule. The lower districts spread below like a tapestry of warm lights, and somewhere among those humble dwellings was a certain crystal-singer with flame-colored hair who had made him look like a fool in front of his own court.

A soft knock interrupted his brooding. "Enter," he called, not bothering to turn from the window.

"My lord." Captain Thorne's voice was carefully formal. "There's been an incident."

Kaelith turned, noting the tension in his guard captain's weathered face. Thorne was normally unflappable—twenty years of military service had taught him to face everything from border skirmishes to political intrigue with the same steady calm. What could have rattled him now?

"What kind of incident?"

"Seismic activity, my lord. The mountain trembled an hour ago—just a small tremor, but it was felt throughout the lower districts. And..." Thorne hesitated.

"And what?"

"The crystal mines reported harmonic disturbances immediately afterward. The singing stones went silent for nearly ten minutes. Some of the miners are saying it's an omen."

*Superstitious fools,* the voice scoffed. *Mountains shift. Stones crack. These things happen.*

But Kaelith felt a chill that had nothing to do with the evening air. The crystal mines were the lifeblood of Crystallumina, their singing stones providing both raw materials and early warning systems for geological instabilities. If they'd gone silent...

"Has anyone consulted the geological surveys?" he asked.

"Master Aldric is reviewing the archives as we speak, my lord. But the old records are... incomplete. Most of the seismic data from before the kingdom's founding was lost during the crystal plague of 2847."

Another tremor chose that moment to roll through the palace, subtle enough that Kaelith might have missed it if he hadn't been listening. But the crystals felt it—every gem in his chambers flickered like candle flames in a breeze, and from somewhere deep below came an answering vibration that seemed to originate in the ruins themselves.

The Lathe was responding to something. He could feel it calling to him, its power resonating with whatever disturbance was building beneath the mountain.

"Thank you, Captain," Kaelith said, already moving toward his door. "Have the morning reports sent to my study. And... keep me informed of any further developments."

Thorne bowed, but his expression remained troubled. "My lord, if I may... during my time in the border regions, I learned that seismic activity can be unpredictable. Perhaps it would be wise to consult with... alternative sources of expertise?"

"Such as?"

"The crystal-singers in the lower districts have been tracking harmonic patterns for generations, my lord. Their knowledge might complement the official surveys."

Kaelith's jaw tightened. Even Thorne was suggesting he needed help from commoners—from her, specifically, though the captain was too diplomatic to say so directly.

*They all doubt you,* the voice whispered. *They all think you need guidance from someone who publicly humiliated you. Show them what real power can accomplish.*

"I'll consider it," Kaelith said stiffly. "That will be all."

The guard captain left, and Kaelith found himself alone with his thoughts and the growing certainty that he needed to return to the ruins. The Lathe would have answers. It always did.

The hidden staircase opened at his touch, recognizing him now as if he belonged there. He descended through the crystalline passages that had become as familiar as his own chambers, guided by the increasing pull of the artifact's presence. With each step, the whispers grew stronger, more insistent.

*The mountain stirs,* they said. *Ancient forces wake. But you have the power to command them all.*

He found the Lathe exactly where he'd left it, resting on its obsidian pedestal in the heart of the deepest chamber. But tonight it seemed different—brighter, more active, its crystalline structure pulsing with rhythms that matched the tremors far below.

When his fingers touched its surface, the connection was immediate and overwhelming. Power flooded through him, but this time it brought visions with it—images of fire and stone, of pressure building in chambers deep beneath Mount Pyreth, of ancient volcanic systems awakening after centuries of slumber.

He saw lava tubes snaking through the mountain's heart like arteries of molten rock. He saw the slow, inexorable rise of magma from depths that hadn't stirred since before the kingdom's founding. And he saw the catastrophic eruption that would come if nothing was done to redirect the building pressure.

But he also saw something else—a solution that only someone with his level of power could achieve. The volcanic forces weren't beyond control; they simply required a crystal user of sufficient strength and will to impose order upon chaos.

*You see?* the voice whispered triumphantly. *This is why the Lathe came to you. This is your destiny—to save the kingdom through mastery that lesser minds cannot comprehend.*

The visions faded, leaving Kaelith gasping on the crystal floor, his hands still tingling with residual power. When he finally stood, his eyes were bright with purpose and something that might have been fever.

He climbed back to the palace with plans forming in his mind, grand designs that would prove his worth to everyone who had ever doubted him. Let them whisper about harmony and collaboration. When Mount Pyreth erupted—and the Lathe had shown him it would, within days—he would be ready. He would save them all through pure, undiluted mastery.

And perhaps, when Zara saw what he was capable of, she would finally understand that he was worthy of her respect. Worthy of much more than that.

But as Kaelith made his way through the sleeping palace, he failed to notice the figure watching from the shadows of the crystal gardens. Master Elyrian stood among the floating gems, his elderly frame supported by his crystal-topped staff, his weathered face creased with worry.

The old man had felt the disturbance in the ruins, had sensed the Lathe's awakening and its growing influence over his former student. More troubling still, he recognized the harmonic signature that had briefly resonated through the palace foundations—a pattern he'd encountered only once before, in his youth, when he'd been part of the expedition that had first sealed the ancient ruins.

Some artifacts, he knew, were buried for good reason.

As another tremor rolled through the mountain, setting every crystal in the garden humming with unease, Master Elyrian made a decision that would change everything. He pulled a communication crystal from his robes and whispered an old phrase in the ancient tongue, activating a network that had lain dormant for decades.

"This is Elyrian," he said quietly to the stone. "The Lathe has been found. The prince is compromised. We need to convene the Circle immediately."

The reply came from a voice he hadn't heard in thirty years: "Understood. We'll gather the old bloodlines. But Elyrian... it may already be too late."

In the distance, Mount Pyreth grumbled with the voice of awakening fire, and in the deep chambers beneath the palace, the Lathe of Light pulsed with hungry anticipation. The pieces were moving into position, and the game was about to enter its most dangerous phase.

Soon, very soon, Prince Kaelith would learn that some kinds of mastery came with a price he might not be willing to pay.
