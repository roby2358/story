# Chapter 4: Tremors of Warning

The earthquake struck at dawn, three days after the courtyard disaster that had left Kaelith's pride in crystalline fragments. He felt it first through the Lathe of Light—a tremor that ran through the artifact's spiraling crystal core like a shiver of premonition. Then the palace itself began to shake, ancient stones groaning as forces deep within the earth shifted and settled in ways they hadn't for generations.

Kaelith stood at his chamber window, watching servants scurry across the courtyard below as aftershocks sent ripples through the fountain pools. The silver streaks in his hair caught the morning light like exposed nerves, and his blue eyes held flecks of that unnatural starlight that marked the Lathe's influence. He should have been concerned—earthquake damage could cripple the kingdom's infrastructure, disrupt trade routes, topple buildings. Instead, he found himself thinking about auburn hair and green eyes that had looked at him with such devastating disappointment.

*Entitled princeling.* The words still echoed in his mind like crystal shards that couldn't be swept away. Three days, and he could still hear the gentle mockery in her voice, still feel the weight of a thousand gazes watching his carefully constructed demonstration crumble into chaos. The courtiers had been appropriately sympathetic afterward, of course—praising his "innovative technique" and dismissing the crystal-singer's "crude display" with the reflexive loyalty expected of their stations. But he had seen the doubt in their eyes, the whispered conversations that stopped when he approached.

A knock at his chamber door interrupted his brooding. "Enter."

Captain Thorne stepped inside with the measured stride of a man who had learned to read royal moods through long experience. The guard captain's bronze skin showed the weathering of someone who had risen through merit rather than birth, and his steady gray eyes held the kind of practical concern that Kaelith had been finding increasingly irritating lately.

"Your Highness," Thorne said with a respectful bow that somehow managed to convey worry alongside proper deference. "Master Geologist Aldwin requests an immediate audience. The seismic readings are... unprecedented."

"Seismic readings." Kaelith turned from the window with a dismissive gesture that made every crystal in his chambers hum with sympathetic resonance. "The earth trembles occasionally, Captain. It's hardly cause for alarm."

"With respect, Your Highness, this appears to be more than occasional trembling." Thorne's voice carried the careful neutrality of someone delivering unwelcome news to an increasingly volatile superior. "The geological instruments are registering patterns that suggest—"

"Instruments." The Lathe's whispers made Kaelith's voice ring with contempt. "Crude mechanical devices that measure only the surface of phenomena they cannot begin to understand. I have access to forces that dwarf mere geological science, Captain. If the kingdom faced true danger, I would sense it through crystal resonance long before any collection of gears and springs could provide warning."

Thorne's expression remained carefully neutral, but something flickered in his gray eyes that might have been concern for his prince's judgment rather than the kingdom's safety. "Master Aldwin specifically mentioned Mount Pyreth, Your Highness. The patterns suggest—"

"Mount Pyreth has been dormant for three centuries." Kaelith's enhanced power made the air itself shimmer with authority. "Its fires died long before my grandfather's time. Whatever the instruments claim to detect, it cannot be volcanic activity."

The captain opened his mouth to continue his report, then visibly reconsidered as he took in the starlight flickering in his prince's eyes. "Of course, Your Highness. Shall I tell Master Aldwin that his audience request has been... postponed?"

"Tell him that the crown prince has more pressing concerns than humoring geological hysteria." Kaelith turned back to the window, effectively dismissing the conversation. "The kingdom's stability depends on crystal harmony, not stone-counting and chart-reading. If Mount Pyreth were truly awakening, every crystal-worker in the realm would feel it."

After Thorne departed with obvious reluctance, Kaelith remained at the window as another tremor rippled through the palace foundations. This one felt different—deeper, more purposeful, as if something vast was stirring in the mountain's heart. The Lathe of Light thrummed against his consciousness with what might have been concern, but its whispers quickly turned the sensation into reassurance. Of course he would know if true danger threatened. Was he not enhanced beyond ordinary mortal limitations? Did he not command crystal forces that could reshape reality itself?

The artifact's influence painted his dismissal of the geological warnings as natural confidence rather than willful blindness. After all, what could instruments and calculations offer that enhanced senses could not provide? The old ways of understanding the world—charts and measurements and cautious observation—were obsolete now that he possessed true power.

But even as the Lathe's whispers soothed his concerns, memory kept returning to the courtyard three days ago. To the way Zara's natural harmony had exposed the artificial nature of his enhanced control. To her words about crystals responding to partnership rather than dominance, about the need to listen rather than command.

*She had felt the tremors too.* The thought came unbidden, carrying implications he didn't want to examine. If crystal-singers truly worked in harmony with the deep forces of the earth, then perhaps her sensitivity to geological disturbance...

No. The Lathe's influence crushed that line of thinking before it could fully form. He was royal blood, heir to a dynasty that had ruled through crystal mastery for a thousand years. Whatever modest talents the commoner possessed, they could not compare to his enhanced abilities. If there were truly cause for concern, he would sense it first and most clearly.

Another tremor shook the palace, this one strong enough to rattle the crystal fixtures in his chambers. From somewhere in the lower districts, he heard the sound of stone falling and voices raised in alarm. Through his enhanced senses, he could feel the distress of crystals throughout the kingdom as the earth's movement disrupted their carefully maintained harmonies.

And beneath it all, like a bass note too low to hear but deep enough to feel in his bones, something massive stirred in the depths of Mount Pyreth. Something that had been sleeping for centuries but was now beginning to wake.

Kaelith gripped the windowsill as another aftershock rippled through the stone beneath his feet. The Lathe of Light whispered reassurances about his superior perception and natural authority, but for a moment—just a moment—he wondered if pride had made him deaf to warnings he should have heeded.

Then the artifact's influence reasserted itself, painting his doubts as weakness and his dismissal of earthbound concerns as appropriate royal confidence. He was above such mundane worries. He commanded forces that transcended mere geology.

But as he stood at his window watching smoke begin to rise from the distant peak of Mount Pyreth, Prince Kaelith Starweaver couldn't quite shake the memory of green eyes that had seen through his enhanced power to the fundamental flaws beneath. Or the terrible possibility that those eyes might be seeing danger his pride had made him blind to recognize.

In the distance, the mountain rumbled like a sleeping giant preparing to wake. And in the lower districts, a crystal-singer who understood harmony felt the earth's distress and began to gather her people for whatever challenges lay ahead.

The game of pride and power was accelerating toward consequences that would reshape the kingdom forever. But for now, the prince stood alone in his tower, dismissing warnings he should have heeded while the Lathe of Light whispered sweet lies about his infallibility.

Some lessons, it seemed, could only be learned through catastrophe.
