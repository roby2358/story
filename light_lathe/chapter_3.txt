# Chapter 3: The Crystal-Singer's Challenge

The Royal Courtyard had never hosted such a crowd. News of Prince Kaelith's "revolutionary advances" in crystal arts had spread through the kingdom like wildfire, drawing spectators from every district and social stratum. Noble ladies in silk gowns shared space with farmers in patched tunics, all craning their necks to see the raised platform where their future king would demonstrate his prowess.

Kaelith stood at the center of it all, resplendent in midnight blue velvet that brought out his eyes, silver threading at his cuffs that matched the streaks in his dark hair. The Lathe of Light remained hidden in the ruins, but its power sang in his blood like wine. He could feel every crystal in the courtyard responding to his presence—the decorative gems adorning the ladies' jewelry, the practical light stones illuminating the platform, even the trace minerals in the stones beneath their feet.

*Show them what power really looks like,* the voice whispered. *Show them why you deserve their worship.*

"My lords and ladies," he began, his voice carrying easily across the courtyard, "today I will demonstrate techniques that push the very boundaries of crystal artistry. What you are about to witness has never been achieved by any practitioner in recorded history."

Murmurs of excitement rippled through the crowd. In the front row, Master Elyrian sat with the other court officials, his expression carefully neutral. Councilor Aldric leaned forward with calculating interest. Captain Thorne stood at attention near the platform's edge, ready to intervene if anything went wrong.

But Kaelith's attention fixed on a figure near the back of the crowd—auburn hair like flame in the afternoon sun, simple brown clothing that should have made her invisible among the finery but somehow made her stand out more. Zara stood with her arms crossed, her green eyes watching him with an expression he couldn't quite read.

Perfect. He'd hoped she would come.

From his belt pouch, Kaelith withdrew a dozen crystals of different types—emeralds, sapphires, rubies, diamonds, each the size of a robin's egg and worth more than most people earned in a year. The crowd gasped as they rose into the air around him, spinning slowly in a complex orbital pattern.

"The traditional approach to crystal harmony," he announced, "requires careful alignment of resonance frequencies, gradual power buildup, and constant attention to maintain balance. Today, I will demonstrate a technique that transcends these limitations."

The crystals began to glow, first softly, then with increasing intensity. Their orbital patterns grew more complex, weaving through three-dimensional space in configurations that should have been impossible to maintain. The Lathe's power flowed through him like liquid lightning, allowing him to command each stone with precision that bordered on the supernatural.

*More,* the voice urged. *Show them something that will make them gasp.*

The crystals suddenly expanded their orbits, flying out over the crowd in brilliant streams of light. Children pointed and laughed as rubies traced fire-trails overhead while emeralds painted the air with green aurora. The gems dove and soared like living things, creating patterns of such complexity and beauty that several of the noble ladies actually applauded.

But Kaelith wasn't done. As the crystals returned to hover above the platform, he began to weave their individual harmonics into a symphony that made the very air vibrate with power. The music was unlike anything ever heard in Crystallumina—not the gentle, natural songs that most crystal-singers produced, but a driving, triumphant anthem that spoke of conquest and dominion.

The crowd was transfixed. He could see awe in their faces, wonder bordering on worship. This was what he'd been born for—this moment of perfect mastery, when every eye was on him and every voice was silenced by his magnificence.

That's when Zara stepped forward.

"All flash, no substance," she called out, her voice cutting through his crystal symphony like a blade through silk.

The music faltered. Several gems wobbled in their patterns as Kaelith's concentration broke. A ripple of shocked murmurs went through the crowd—who was this girl from the lower districts to challenge the prince during a royal demonstration?

"I beg your pardon?" Kaelith managed, his voice tight with embarrassment and rising anger.

Zara pushed through the crowd until she stood at the platform's edge, her chin raised in that defiant angle he was beginning to know all too well. "I said it's all flash, no substance. Flashy technique, certainly. Impressive power, no doubt. But you're not creating harmony—you're imposing dominance."

*How dare she,* the voice hissed. *How dare this common-born nobody question your mastery in front of the entire court?*

"Perhaps you'd care to demonstrate what you consider proper technique?" Kaelith's words dripped with aristocratic disdain, but underneath the condescension was a challenge that made the crowd lean forward in anticipation.

"Gladly."

Zara stepped onto the platform without invitation, and Kaelith had to resist the urge to order the guards to remove her. She carried no crystals, wore no jewelry, brought nothing but herself and that insufferable confidence.

She began to sing.

It wasn't the driving anthem Kaelith had been weaving, but something softer and infinitely more complex—a melody that seemed to rise from the earth itself and spiral up through the various harmonic layers until it touched something ancient and eternal. Every crystal in the courtyard began to respond, not just the ones floating above the platform but every gem present, every decorative stone, every trace mineral in the architecture itself.

And they sang with her.

The effect was breathtaking. Where Kaelith's demonstration had been a display of individual mastery, this was something else entirely—a conversation between singer and stone that included everyone present. The crystals in the ladies' jewelry added their voices to the chorus. The light stones illuminating the courtyard pulsed in perfect rhythm. Even the marble platform began to resonate with harmonics that made the soles of their feet tingle.

For a moment, Kaelith was so captivated by the beauty of it that he forgot to be angry. This was what she'd been trying to show him in the garden, in the courtyard with the children—not the raw exhibition of power, but the delicate art of collaboration. The crystals weren't being commanded; they were being invited to participate in something larger than themselves.

Then the voice in his head snarled, and his pride reasserted itself with the force of a thunderclap.

*She's making you look like a fool in front of your own subjects! Show her what real power looks like!*

Kaelith reached for his floating crystals with every ounce of enhanced ability the Lathe had given him. The gems blazed with sudden, harsh light as he forced them back into his own harmonic pattern, drowning out Zara's gentle song with a cascade of raw power that made the air itself scream.

The effect was immediate and catastrophic.

Two opposing harmonic systems, one based on collaboration and one on domination, crashed together like opposing armies. The air between them crackled with visible energy, and every crystal in the courtyard—both theirs and the spectators'—began to vibrate at frequencies that made them glow red-hot.

"Stop!" Master Elyrian shouted from the crowd, but it was too late.

The crystals began to explode.

It started with the smallest gems—the decorative stones in jewelry and hair ornaments—popping like tiny fireworks as their internal structures shattered under the harmonic stress. Then the light stones went, plunging sections of the courtyard into darkness as they failed in cascading sequence. The floating crystals above the platform blazed like miniature suns before erupting in showers of glittering fragments that rained down on the scrambling crowd.

The spectacle ended with Kaelith's dozen prize gems, the ones he'd been using for his demonstration. They hung in the air for one perfect moment, glowing so brightly they hurt to look at, before exploding simultaneously in a concussion that knocked half the people in the front row off their feet.

In the sudden silence that followed, Kaelith and Zara stood facing each other across the ruined platform, both breathing hard, both lit by the fading glow of destroyed crystals. The prince's hands were shaking—whether from exertion or rage, he couldn't tell. The crystal-singer's green eyes blazed with something that might have been fury or disappointment or both.

"Crystals respond to harmony, not dominance," she said quietly, her voice carrying in the absolute silence. "That artifact you're using—it's making you deaf to their true song."

*She knows,* the voice whispered urgently. *She knows about the Lathe. She'll try to take it from you, try to convince others you're not worthy of such power.*

"I don't know what you're talking about," Kaelith said, but even he could hear how hollow the denial sounded.

Zara studied his face for a long moment, and he saw something shift in her expression—the anger fading into something that looked disturbingly like pity. "No," she said softly. "I don't think you do."

She turned to address the crowd, many of whom were still picking crystal fragments out of their hair and clothing. "Are you all right? Is anyone hurt?"

As if her words had broken a spell, the courtyard erupted into confused chatter. People began calling out—no serious injuries, thankfully, though there were plenty of minor cuts and a few singed eyebrows. Captain Thorne was already organizing his guards to help the injured and clean up the debris. Master Elyrian was staring at the platform with an expression of profound concern.

But Zara wasn't paying attention to any of that. She was walking away, moving through the crowd with that same confident stride that had captivated Kaelith from their first meeting. As she reached the courtyard's edge, she paused and looked back at him.

"For what it's worth, Your Highness," she called out, "I hope you figure it out before it's too late."

Then she was gone, disappearing into the growing dusk beyond the palace walls, leaving behind only the memory of her voice and the scattered wreckage of what should have been his greatest triumph.

"An entitled princeling," he heard someone whisper in the crowd—a voice he recognized as belonging to one of the merchants who'd watched the demonstration. "All that power and no idea how to use it properly."

The words hit him like physical blows. He stood alone on the ruined platform, surrounded by the debris of his humiliation, feeling the stares of hundreds of people who had come to witness his mastery and instead seen him reduced to a petulant child throwing a tantrum.

*This is her fault,* the voice whispered, but for the first time since finding the Lathe, it sounded uncertain. *She provoked you. She made you look foolish. She...*

But even as the voice tried to direct his anger toward Zara, Kaelith found his thoughts returning to the moment when their opposing harmonics had clashed. For just an instant, before the crystals began to explode, he'd felt something—a connection, a resonance between them that had nothing to do with crystal arts and everything to do with the electricity that seemed to spark whenever they were in the same space.

She'd challenged him, humiliated him, called him an entitled princeling in front of his own subjects. She'd made him look like a fool and then walked away without a backward glance.

So why was his pulse racing? Why did he feel more alive in this moment of complete defeat than he had during all his earlier displays of enhanced power?

And why, despite everything, was he already planning how to see her again?

*You want her,* the voice whispered, and this time it sounded almost... amused. *You want to possess her, to make her submit, to show her that you are stronger and worthier and more deserving of respect. She will be yours, my prince. Power takes what it desires.*

Kaelith closed his eyes and tried to shut out the whispers, but they echoed in his mind long after the courtyard had emptied and the servants had swept away the last of the crystal fragments. Even as he walked back to his chambers alone, he could still hear Zara's voice, could still see the disappointed pity in her green eyes.

And somewhere deep in the ruins beneath the palace, the Lathe of Light pulsed with satisfied warmth, feeding on pride wounded and desire kindled, growing stronger with each passing hour.

The game had only just begun.
