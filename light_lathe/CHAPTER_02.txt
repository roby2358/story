# Chapter 2: The Lathe Awakens

The private chambers of Prince Kaelith had never known such brilliance. Crystalline formations that had adorned his walls for years—gifts from master artisans, trophies of his own achievements, rare specimens from the deepest mines—all blazed with newfound radiance as the Lathe of Light rested upon his desk like a slumbering dragon.

Three hours had passed since his ascent from the ancient chambers, and Kaelith could not bring himself to look away from the artifact. Its surface continued to shift and flow, veins of pure diamond threading through amethyst and emerald in patterns that seemed to respond to his very thoughts. The three spindles hummed with barely contained energy, each one singing a different note in harmonies that made his enhanced senses tingle with anticipation.

He had already accomplished more in these few hours than in months of previous practice. A simple gesture toward the window had caused the dawn light to bend and dance in ways that defied natural law. When he had idly traced a pattern in the air with his finger, crystal formations had grown from nothing, taking shape according to his will with a precision that would have taken him days to achieve through conventional means.

The power was intoxicating. Addictive. Each success made him hunger for the next challenge, the next impossible feat to master.

A sharp knock at his chamber door interrupted his contemplation. "Your Highness," came the voice of Captain Thorne, his tone carrying the weight of official business. "Your father requests your immediate presence in the throne room. Lord Malachar has returned from the eastern provinces with urgent news."

Kaelith's jaw tightened at the mention of his uncle. Malachar had always harbored ambitions above his station, and his prolonged absence had brought a welcome peace to the court. Whatever news he brought would undoubtedly serve his own interests first.

"Tell my father I'll attend him shortly," Kaelith called back, not moving from his position beside the lathe. "I'm reviewing important... documents."

Through the thick oak door, he heard Captain Thorne's hesitation. "Your Highness, the king was quite specific about the urgency. Lord Malachar speaks of seismic activity that threatens the kingdom."

Seismic activity. The words penetrated the haze of fascination that surrounded Kaelith like cold water. He remembered Master Elyrian's mention of tremors, the warning that had seemed so trivial compared to his discovery. But surely such matters could wait. What were earthquakes compared to the power he now possessed?

As if sensing his thoughts, the Lathe of Light pulsed with warm encouragement. The artifact's whispers—not quite voices, but impressions of vast potential—urged him to trust in his enhanced abilities. Natural disasters were challenges to be overcome, not feared. With this power, he could protect the kingdom better than any army.

"Captain," Kaelith said, rising to his feet and lifting the lathe with reverent care. "Inform my father that his son comes armed with capabilities beyond anything the court has seen. Whatever crisis my uncle speaks of, it will not find me unprepared."

The throne room of Crystallumina had witnessed five centuries of royal audiences, its vaulted ceiling supported by pillars of living crystal that grew from the palace foundations themselves. Today, those pillars sang with agitated harmonics, responding to the tension that filled the air like the charge before a storm.

King Aldren Starweaver sat upon the Throne of Lights, a massive chair carved from a single piece of rainbow crystal that reflected his mood in shifting hues. Today, the crystal showed deep purples and angry reds—concern and barely controlled frustration. His silver-streaked hair, identical to his son's, was disheveled from running his hands through it, and the lines around his blue eyes had deepened since Kaelith had last seen him.

Beside the throne stood Lord Malachar, tall and imposing in his dark traveling clothes. Where the king showed concern, Malachar radiated cold satisfaction, his amber eyes gleaming with the kind of anticipation that came from being the bearer of crisis. His graying hair was perfectly groomed despite his journey, and his smile held the sharp edge of a blade.

"Ah, nephew," Malachar said as Kaelith entered, his gaze immediately fixing on the artifact in the prince's hands. "I see you've found something interesting during my absence."

The moment the Lathe of Light crossed the threshold of the throne room, every crystal formation in the chamber responded. The pillars brightened, the throne's colors shifted to brilliant gold, and smaller gems throughout the hall began to sing in harmonies that made the air itself shimmer. Several courtiers gasped at the display, stepping back from the sheer magnitude of power that radiated from the ancient artifact.

King Aldren's eyes widened as he felt the familiar resonance of crystal magic magnified a hundredfold. "Kaelith, what is that?"

"A tool of legends, Father," Kaelith replied, unable to keep the pride from his voice as he approached the throne. "Discovered in the ruins beneath our palace—proof that the old masters were more than myth. With this, I can accomplish feats that would have taken generations to master."

Malachar's expression grew predatory. "How fortuitous. The kingdom will need every advantage in the days to come."

He stepped forward, unrolling a map of the eastern provinces that trembled slightly in his hands—whether from excitement or the Lathe's resonance, Kaelith couldn't tell. The parchment showed Mount Pyreth, the ancient volcano that had provided the kingdom's crystal wealth for centuries, marked with red symbols that indicated seismic activity.

"The mountain stirs, Your Majesty," Malachar continued, his voice carrying the gravity of impending doom. "My surveys recorded tremors increasing in both frequency and magnitude over the past weeks. The old lava tubes are shifting, and thermal vents that have remained cold for centuries now glow with inner fire."

King Aldren leaned forward, his weathered hands gripping the crystal armrests of his throne. "How long before...?"

"Days, Your Majesty. Perhaps less." Malachar's tone held just the right note of regret, but Kaelith caught the glint of satisfaction in his uncle's amber eyes. "The mountain will erupt with a force not seen for five hundred years. The lava flows will follow the old paths—straight through the valley settlements and toward the capital itself."

A murmur of fear rippled through the assembled courtiers. Crystallumina had been built assuming Pyreth would remain dormant, its wealth-providing slopes a blessing rather than a curse. An eruption of the magnitude Malachar described would devastate the kingdom.

But as the court descended into worried whispers, Kaelith felt only excitement. The Lathe of Light hummed in his hands, its whispers growing stronger, filling his mind with visions of impossible solutions. Redirecting lava flows. Containing volcanic force. Proving his worth beyond all question.

"There is an answer," he said, his voice cutting through the rising panic with authority that surprised even him. "The ancient texts speak of a Harmony Crystal—a legendary gem that could channel forces beyond normal comprehension. With the right power source, it could redirect even a volcano's fury."

Master Elyrian, who had remained silent in the corner of the throne room, stepped forward with alarm written across his weathered features. "Your Highness, the texts you speak of are myths and fragments. No one has seen a Harmony Crystal for—"

"For centuries," Kaelith finished, his blue eyes blazing with reflected power from the artifact in his hands. "But then, no one has wielded tools like this for just as long."

He raised the Lathe of Light, and its three spindles began to glow with increasing intensity. The leftmost spindle, golden as captured sunlight, projected a beam of pure energy that carved intricate patterns in the air. Where the light touched, reality seemed to bend, space folding in ways that made the mind struggle to comprehend.

"My gods," breathed one of the court mages, a woman whose own crystal abilities had been considered exceptional until this moment. "That power—it's impossible."

"Nothing is impossible," Kaelith declared, drunk on the harmonics that filled his enhanced senses. "Not anymore. I can locate the Harmony Crystal and wield it to save our kingdom. But I'll need to act swiftly."

King Aldren rose from his throne, hope and concern warring in his expression. "Son, if such a crystal exists, the search could take months. You speak of power I've never seen, but even you cannot—"

"Cannot what?" Kaelith's voice carried an edge that made several courtiers step back. The Lathe's whispers grew stronger, feeding his growing confidence until it bordered on arrogance. "Father, you've seen what I can accomplish with conventional crystals. With this artifact, I'm no longer bound by normal limitations."

Malachar moved closer, his amber eyes fixed hungrily on the ancient device. "Perhaps, nephew, we should work together on this. My knowledge of the eastern provinces, combined with your... enhanced abilities... could—"

"Could slow me down with unnecessary caution," Kaelith cut him off, pulling the Lathe protectively against his chest. The artifact's power whispered warnings about sharing, about trusting others with abilities they couldn't understand or appreciate. "This is my discovery, my responsibility. I'll handle the crisis myself."

Master Elyrian's face grew grave as he recognized the shift in his former student's demeanor. "Kaelith, listen to yourself. The pride in your voice, the dismissal of others' counsel—these are not the words of the prince I helped train."

"Because I'm no longer that prince," Kaelith replied, his eyes flashing with crystalline fire. "I've transcended those limitations. The old ways of careful study and gradual progress were holding me back from my true potential."

The chamber fell silent except for the singing of crystals responding to the Lathe's resonance. King Aldren looked between his son and his brother, seeing ambition in both their faces but recognizing only one as truly dangerous in this moment.

"Very well," the king said finally, his voice heavy with reluctant acceptance. "If you believe you can locate this Harmony Crystal and prevent the disaster, you have my permission to try. But Kaelith—" His tone grew stern, paternal authority breaking through royal protocol. "Remember that a king's power means nothing if he has no subjects left to protect."

Kaelith barely heard the warning. The Lathe of Light pulsed with approval, its whispers promising that success would prove his worthiness beyond all doubt. He was already envisioning the moment of triumph, the grateful faces of his people as he saved them through superior skill and ancient power.

"I'll need to study the old maps," he said, his mind racing with possibilities. "Chart the most likely locations based on crystal formation patterns and geological stability. The Harmony Crystal won't be easy to find, but—"

"Actually," Malachar interrupted smoothly, "there may be a more direct approach. During my surveys, I encountered some... unusual individuals in the eastern settlements. Common folk with remarkable natural crystal abilities—untrained but powerful. One in particular caught my attention: a young woman who seemed to make crystals sing with nothing but her voice."

The description sent an unexpected jolt through Kaelith's chest. A woman who could sing to crystals—could he have found another wielder of exceptional talent? The thought should have excited him professionally, but instead it kindled something darker, more possessive. The Lathe's whispers grew seductive, painting visions of claiming such power for himself.

"Her name?" he asked, trying to keep his voice casual.

"Zara something," Malachar replied with studied indifference. "A crystal-singer from the lower districts. Crude technique, of course, but raw potential that could be... refined under proper guidance."

The name hit Kaelith like a physical blow. Zara—the defiant woman who had challenged his abilities at court, who had looked at him with such dismissive contempt. The memory of their encounter blazed fresh in his mind: her auburn hair catching fire as their energies clashed, the way she had walked away from him with her chin raised in proud refusal.

The Lathe of Light responded to his sudden spike of emotion, its spindles flaring with dangerous brilliance. The whispers turned urgent, insistent—she had power that belonged with his, abilities that would complement the artifact's enhancement. She could be claimed, tamed, made to serve a greater purpose.

"I know of her," he said, his voice tight with barely controlled intensity. "She'll serve my purposes perfectly."

Master Elyrian stepped forward, alarm clear in his weathered features. "Your Highness, if you're considering seeking this woman's aid, perhaps you should approach her with—"

"With the authority my station and abilities deserve," Kaelith finished, the Lathe's corruption bleeding into his words like poison. "She'll recognize strength when she sees it."

But even as he spoke, doubt flickered in the depths of his mind. Zara had already refused him once, in front of the entire court. Her green eyes had flashed with defiance that had both infuriated and aroused him. The memory of that humiliation burned, but so did something else—a grudging respect for her fierce independence.

The Lathe's whispers drowned out such concerns, replacing them with visions of dominance and control. She would serve because she would have no choice. His enhanced power would compel her compliance.

"The evening grows late," King Aldren observed, noting the tension that filled the chamber like storm clouds. "Perhaps we should all rest and approach these challenges with fresh minds tomorrow."

As the court began to disperse, Malachar lingered near the throne, his amber eyes following the Lathe of Light with undisguised hunger. "Nephew," he called softly, his voice carrying just far enough to reach Kaelith's enhanced hearing. "When you find this crystal-singer, remember that even the most powerful require... appropriate motivation to reach their full potential."

The implication in his uncle's tone made Kaelith's grip tighten protectively on the ancient artifact. Whatever games Malachar was playing, they would not involve the Lathe of Light—or Zara.

That night, alone in his chambers with the artifact resting beside his bed, Kaelith dreamed of auburn hair and defiant green eyes. In his dreams, Zara knelt before him with her head bowed in submission, her voice raised not in challenge but in harmony with his own enhanced power. The Lathe of Light sang approval, its whispers promising that such visions could become reality.

But beneath the artifact's seductive promises, buried so deep that even his enhanced awareness could barely detect it, a small voice of conscience whispered warnings about the price of such power.

The voice grew fainter with each passing hour, drowning beneath the Lathe's intoxicating song of absolute dominion.

By dawn, Prince Kaelith Starweaver had made his decision. He would seek out Zara Brightforge—not as a supplicant requesting aid, but as a master claiming what was rightfully his. The kingdom's salvation would come through his superior abilities, and she would serve that greater purpose whether she wished it or not.

The Lathe of Light pulsed with malevolent satisfaction, its corruption spreading deeper into the prince's heart with every beat.
