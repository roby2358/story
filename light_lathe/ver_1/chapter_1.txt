# Chapter 1: Dawn Practice

The first light of dawn painted the Crystal Gardens in shades of rose and gold, each suspended gem catching the early rays and fracturing them into rainbow cascades. Prince Kaelith Starweaver stood at the center of the floating maze, his silver-streaked hair catching the light as he guided three emerald crystals through an intricate aerial dance. The stones hummed with power, responding to the subtle movements of his scarred hands.

Below in the valley, his subjects were already at work—farmers tending their fields, crystal miners heading toward the tunnels, merchants opening their stalls. From his elevated position in the palace gardens, they looked like industrious ants, their lives small and predictable. Kaelith preferred it this way, alone with his crystals and his ambitions, where no one could question his techniques or suggest he might be wanting for anything.

He was, after all, going to be the greatest crystal artisan in the history of Crystallumina.

The emeralds spun faster now, their harmonics building into a complex symphony that made the air itself shimmer. Kaelith's blue eyes glowed with channeled energy as he attempted something he'd been practicing for weeks—a seven-point crystalline matrix that would demonstrate his mastery beyond any doubt. The gems arranged themselves into a perfect heptagon, their combined power enough to light the entire garden.

"Almost," he breathed, sweat beading on his forehead as he fought to maintain control. The crystals vibrated at the edge of their tolerance, their song growing sharp and discordant. Just a little more pressure, a bit more will, and he would achieve—

The largest emerald exploded.

Crystal shards rained down like green snow, and Kaelith stumbled backward with a curse that would have made his tutors faint. The remaining gems tumbled to the marble walkway with distinctly unmusical crashes.

"That's not how crystals work, princeling."

Kaelith spun toward the voice, his pride smarting worse than the small cuts from the crystal fragments. A young woman stepped out from behind a flowering crystal tree, her auburn hair catching fire in the morning light. She wore the simple brown tunic of the lower districts, but there was nothing simple about the way she moved—like a dancer, or perhaps a predator.

"You're forcing them instead of listening," she continued, green eyes flashing with what looked suspiciously like amusement. "Crystals aren't hammers, you know. They're more like... songbirds."

"How dare you—" Kaelith began, but she was already kneeling among the scattered shards, her calloused hands gentle as she gathered them up.

"Like this," she said, and began to hum.

It was a low, wordless melody that seemed to rise from somewhere deeper than her throat. The crystal fragments in her palms began to glow, not with the harsh light Kaelith had been forcing from them, but with a soft radiance that pulsed in time with her song. One by one, the shards lifted from her hands and began to dance—not in the rigid formation Kaelith had demanded, but in flowing, organic patterns that somehow felt more right than anything he'd ever achieved.

"You see?" she said, still humming as the crystals wove through the air between them. "They want to sing together. They don't want to be commanded."

Kaelith stared, his mouth dry. The display was beautiful in a way his had never been—natural, effortless, profound. It made his seven-point matrix look like a child's fumbling attempt at artistry.

"Who are you?" he managed.

She let the crystals settle gently onto the walkway, their glow fading as her song ended. "Someone who knows the difference between mastery and domination." She straightened, and he was surprised to find she was nearly as tall as him, her chin tilted at an angle that suggested she wasn't in the habit of bowing to anyone. "The question is, do you?"

Before he could answer, she was walking away, her brown boots silent on the marble. Kaelith watched her go, noting the confident set of her shoulders, the way her hair moved like flame in the morning breeze. He realized, with something between irritation and fascination, that she hadn't told him her name.

"Wait!" he called, but she was already disappearing through the garden's outer gate.

Kaelith knelt among the scattered crystal fragments, touching one with the tip of his finger. It flickered with residual warmth from her song, and for a moment he could almost hear the echo of that deeper harmony she'd shown him.

Then his pride reasserted itself. She was nobody—a commoner who'd somehow learned a few parlor tricks with crystals. What did she know about true artistry? About the responsibilities that came with power? About the pressure of being destined for greatness?

He gathered the shards roughly, shoving them into the leather pouch at his belt. As he stood, his foot caught on a loose marble stone that had been displaced by the crystal explosion. The stone tilted, revealing a dark gap beneath.

Kaelith frowned and knelt again, this time running his fingers along the edge of the walkway. The marble shifted under pressure, and suddenly an entire section slid aside with a grinding sound that echoed across the garden. Below was a staircase carved from living crystal, descending into darkness that seemed to pulse with its own faint luminescence.

"Ancient ruins," he breathed, his heart racing. "Beneath the palace all this time."

He should report this to the Council, of course. Should summon the court historians and the master architects. Should do everything properly and officially and responsibly.

Instead, Prince Kaelith Starweaver glanced around to ensure he was still alone, then stepped onto the crystal stairs and began his descent into the darkness. The ruins called to him with whispers of old power and forgotten secrets, promising answers to questions he'd never known he needed to ask.

Behind him, the entrance sealed itself with barely a whisper, and the Crystal Gardens returned to their peaceful morning routine—as if nothing had changed, as if the world hadn't just cracked open to reveal its hidden depths.

But in the shadows between the crystal trees, a pair of green eyes watched the place where the prince had disappeared, and Zara Brightforge found herself wondering what, exactly, she'd just set in motion.
