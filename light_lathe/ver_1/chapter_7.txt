# Chapter 7: The Quest Begins

The Lathe of Light hummed with anticipation as Kaelith prepared for his departure. In the crystal chamber deep beneath the palace, he studied ancient maps that seemed to write themselves across the artifact's luminous surface—routes through treacherous mountain passes, hidden caves marked with symbols that hurt to look at directly, pathways that existed only when the right harmonic frequencies opened them.

*The Harmony Crystal waits in the Sanctuary of Echoes,* the voice whispered as the maps shifted and reformed. *Three days' journey into the Whispering Peaks, past trials that would break lesser minds. But you are no ordinary seeker. You have the power to claim what others could only dream of.*

Kaelith traced the route with one finger, memorizing each landmark and hazard. The journey would be dangerous—the ancient texts spoke of tests that challenged not just magical ability but will and purpose. Many had sought the legendary crystal over the centuries. None had returned.

But none of them had possessed the Lathe of Light.

"My lord?" Captain Thorne's voice echoed down the crystal stairs. "You sent for me?"

Kaelith quickly covered the artifact with a silk cloth, though its glow still leaked around the edges. "I'll be leaving the palace for several days," he said as Thorne descended into the chamber. "I want you to maintain normal security protocols and assure the court that the situation is under control."

The guard captain's weathered face creased with concern as he took in the ancient chamber, his eyes lingering on the covered artifact with obvious unease. "My lord, perhaps it would be wise to take an escort. The mountain paths are treacherous even in good weather, and with the current seismic activity..."

"I work better alone."

"Sir, with respect, the volcanic situation is deteriorating rapidly. If something were to happen to you while you're away from the palace—"

"Nothing will happen to me." Kaelith's voice carried a confidence that was equal parts natural arrogance and the Lathe's influence. "I have resources sufficient to handle any challenge I might encounter."

Thorne glanced again at the covered artifact, his expression troubled. "My lord, I've served your family for fifteen years. I've never questioned your judgment, but the entire court is on edge about these tremors, and your uncle has been asking pointed questions about your recent... innovations... in crystal work."

*Your uncle suspects,* the voice warned. *He wants to undermine your authority while you're vulnerable. Don't give him the opportunity.*

"What kind of questions?"

"About where your new abilities came from. About whether you've discovered artifacts or techniques that the court should be aware of. He's... persistent."

Kaelith felt a chill that had nothing to do with the underground chamber's temperature. Malachar had always been too perceptive, too ambitious. If he was actively investigating the source of the enhanced power...

"My uncle is welcome to his curiosity," Kaelith said carefully. "But my methods are my own concern."

"Of course, my lord. But if Lord Malachar were to approach the Council with concerns about... unconventional approaches to the crisis... it might be beneficial to have official documentation of your plans."

The suggestion made sense from a political standpoint, but it also implied a level of accountability that the Lathe's whispers found distinctly unpalatable. Why should he justify his actions to lesser minds? Why should he constrain his methods to satisfy those too weak to understand true power?

"I'll consider it," he said finally. "For now, simply ensure that my absence doesn't create unnecessary alarm."

After Thorne left, looking less than satisfied with the conversation, Kaelith spent another hour with the Lathe, absorbing its guidance about the trials ahead. The crystal showed him glimpses of what waited in the Sanctuary of Echoes—tests of will that would strip away pretense and reveal the seeker's true nature, guardians that responded only to absolute certainty of purpose, final chambers where the weak of spirit would find only death.

But it also showed him the prize: the Harmony Crystal itself, a gem the size of a man's torso that pulsed with the concentrated power of creation itself. With such an artifact under his control, he could do more than merely redirect Mount Pyreth's eruption—he could reshape the volcanic system entirely, turn destructive force into a tool for expanding the kingdom's power.

*This is your destiny,* the voice whispered as the visions faded. *This is why you were chosen. Not to preserve the status quo, but to transform it entirely.*

He left before dawn, slipping out of the palace through passages he'd learned as a child. The royal stables were empty except for a few sleepy grooms, and Kaelith selected a strong mountain horse without bothering to inform anyone of his choice. By the time the sun crested the eastern peaks, he was already miles into the foothills, following trails that grew steadily more treacherous as they climbed toward the Whispering Peaks.

The landscape around him showed increasing signs of volcanic disturbance. Trees bore scorch marks from superheated gases, streams ran warm with mineral deposits, and the very air shimmered with thermal updrafts that made the horizon dance like a mirage. But the Lathe's power insulated him from the worst effects, maintaining a bubble of stable temperature and clean air that allowed him to press forward when ordinary travelers would have been forced to turn back.

By midday he encountered his first real obstacle: a gorge that hadn't existed on any map, clearly torn open by recent seismic activity. The gap was nearly a hundred feet across, with sides too steep to climb down and no visible way around.

*Fear not,* the voice whispered. *Show the mountain what true mastery looks like.*

Kaelith dismounted and approached the edge of the chasm, feeling the Lathe's power building in his chest like compressed lightning. He reached out with enhanced senses, identifying the crystal deposits in the surrounding rock, the trace minerals that could serve as resonance points for his will.

When he began to sing—not the gentle, collaborative melodies that Zara favored, but a commanding aria that demanded obedience from stone and metal—the very cliffs responded. Crystal formations burst from the rock walls like frozen waterfalls, their jagged surfaces creating handholds and ledges that formed a bridge across the gap.

The effort left him breathing hard but exhilarated. Such casual reshaping of the landscape would have been impossible with conventional techniques, but the Lathe made it feel natural, even inevitable. He was beginning to understand what true power meant—not the careful balance that his mentors had taught him, but the absolute authority to impose his will upon reality itself.

The horse proved less enthusiastic about crossing a bridge made of freshly created crystal, but Kaelith's enhanced abilities extended to animal empathy. A few whispered words charged with magical compulsion, and the beast stepped obediently onto the crystalline path.

*See how easy it becomes when you stop asking permission?* the voice murmured as they crossed safely to the far side. *Imagine what you could accomplish if you approached all obstacles with such decisive action.*

The trail beyond the gorge led into increasingly surreal territory. The Whispering Peaks earned their name from the way wind moved through the crystal formations that jutted from every cliff face, creating harmonics that seemed almost like conversation. But as Kaelith climbed higher, the whispers began to sound more and more like actual voices—fragments of words in languages he didn't recognize, snatches of melody that made his skin crawl with unease.

*Ancient voices,* the Lathe explained. *The echoes of those who sought the Harmony Crystal before you. They failed because they lacked the strength to silence the doubts that the mountain uses to test worthiness.*

"What kind of doubts?"

*You'll see. But remember—you are not like them. You have power they could never imagine. Trust in that power, and no trial can defeat you.*

The first real test came as the sun was setting behind the western peaks. Kaelith had been following a narrow ledge around a particularly treacherous cliff face when the path simply... ended. Not collapsed or blocked, but stopped, as if it had never extended any further.

Behind him, the way he'd come was gone as well. The ledge now terminated at both ends, leaving him stranded on a shelf of rock barely six feet wide, with sheer drops stretching into darkness on three sides.

"An illusion," he said aloud, but his voice sounded thin and uncertain in the mountain air.

*Not an illusion,* the voice corrected. *A choice. The mountain is asking what you value more—safety or power. Do you retreat to the comfort of familiar limitations, or do you leap forward into the unknown?*

Kaelith looked out into the darkness beyond the cliff, seeing nothing but empty air and the distant glow of volcanic vents far below. But the Lathe's power showed him something else—a hidden path that existed only for those with sufficient will to see it, a bridge of crystallized moonlight that would support him only as long as his conviction remained absolute.

*Trust the power,* the voice whispered. *Trust yourself. Show the mountain that you fear nothing.*

He stepped forward into apparent emptiness—and found solid crystal beneath his feet. The bridge was invisible to normal sight but perfectly real to enhanced perception, a pathway that glowed with the same inner light as the Lathe itself. Each step required absolute faith that the next would find purchase, that his enhanced abilities were sufficient to overcome the most basic limitations of physics.

As he crossed, other paths became visible branching off in different directions—dozens of potential routes leading to destinations he couldn't identify. But the Lathe's guidance was clear: straight ahead, no matter what temptations or alternatives presented themselves.

*This is what separates the worthy from the weak,* the voice explained as he reached solid ground on the far side. *The willingness to follow power wherever it leads, without compromise or hesitation.*

The horse, of course, couldn't make the crossing. Kaelith felt a moment of regret as he looked back at the faithful animal, still standing on the impossible ledge, but the feeling was quickly subsumed by the intoxicating rush of progress. He was beyond such mundane concerns now, sustained by forces that transcended physical needs.

The night passed in a blur of climbing through increasingly surreal landscape. Reality seemed more... flexible... at these altitudes, as if the proximity to ancient power had worn thin the boundaries between what was and what could be. Kaelith found himself walking through forests of crystalline trees that sang lullabies in languages he'd never heard, crossing streams that flowed upward toward the stars, navigating mazes of stone that rearranged themselves when he wasn't looking directly at them.

But the Lathe's guidance never wavered, and neither did his conviction. Each impossible sight simply confirmed what he'd been learning over the past weeks—that conventional limitations were for conventional minds. He was beyond such constraints now, free to explore realms of possibility that others could barely imagine.

As dawn broke over the highest peaks, revealing the entrance to the Sanctuary of Echoes carved into the living rock ahead, Kaelith felt more confident than he'd ever been in his life. The trials had been challenging but not overwhelming, the path difficult but not impassable. Soon he would claim the Harmony Crystal, return to save his kingdom, and prove to everyone—especially a certain crystal-singer with flame-colored hair—that true power required no collaboration, no compromise, no acknowledgment of weakness.

The voice in his head purred with satisfaction as he approached the sanctuary's entrance. Everything was proceeding exactly as planned.

But in the growing daylight, Kaelith failed to notice that his reflection in the crystal formations around the entrance showed someone quite different from the confident prince he believed himself to be—someone with eyes that glowed with unnatural light, skin that seemed translucent with the power flowing beneath it, and an expression of such absolute certainty that it bordered on madness.

The trials ahead would test more than his magical abilities. They would test whether anything remained of the man he had been before the Lathe's whispers began reshaping his very soul.
