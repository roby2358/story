# Chapter 6: Pride's Bitter Bargain

The tremors had grown stronger overnight, and by mid-morning the palace's crystal harmonics were so disrupted that basic functions were becoming difficult. Light stones flickered unpredictably, communication crystals carried static along with messages, and the ornamental gems throughout the court had developed an unpleasant tendency to emit discordant humming sounds that set everyone's teeth on edge.

Kaelith stood in the council chamber, listening to increasingly dire reports from geological surveyors, mining foremen, and crystal technicians. The picture they painted was clear: Mount Pyreth was building toward an eruption that would devastate the kingdom within days, possibly hours. Traditional methods of volcanic management—crystal networks designed to channel and dissipate geological pressure—were proving insufficient against the scale of what was building.

"The mountain's too unstable," reported Master Aldric, the head geological surveyor, his usually pristine robes stained with ash from his emergency surveys. "The old crystal arrays we installed after the minor eruption of 2851 weren't designed for this level of activity. We'd need something on the order of the legendary Harmony Crystal to handle forces of this magnitude."

"And where exactly do we find such a crystal?" Councilor Aldric asked, his calculating green eyes fixed on Kaelith.

"The archives mention several locations," Master Aldric replied. "But most are theoretical. The actual Harmony Crystal was lost centuries ago, along with the knowledge of how to create new ones."

*Lost,* the voice in Kaelith's head scoffed. *They lack the vision to see what's possible with sufficient power. You could handle this alone if you were willing to use your full potential.*

But even as the whispers tried to convince him, Kaelith found his thoughts turning to a different solution. The memory of Zara's demonstration in the Royal Courtyard haunted him—not the humiliation of their conflicting harmonics, but the moment before the crystals began to explode, when her natural power had resonated with something deeper than technique. If anyone could help him locate and work with a legendary artifact, it would be someone who understood crystals on that intuitive level.

The realization left a bitter taste in his mouth. After everything that had happened between them, after the public embarrassment and her dismissive attitude toward his abilities, the idea of asking her for help felt like chewing glass.

But the alternative was watching his kingdom burn.

"I'll handle it," he announced, cutting through the increasingly frantic discussions around the council table. "I have resources the rest of you aren't aware of."

Lord Malachar, who had been listening silently from his seat near the head of the table, raised an eyebrow. "Resources, nephew? I hope you're not planning another solo expedition. The mountain won't wait for individual heroics."

The comment stung because it was accurate. Kaelith's enhanced abilities were impressive, but even the Lathe's power had limits. What he needed was a partner—someone whose natural talent could complement his enhanced strength.

Someone who infuriated him almost as much as she fascinated him.

"I'll assemble a team," he said stiffly. "We leave at dawn."

But first, he had a crystal-singer to convince.

Finding Zara proved more difficult than expected. She wasn't in the lower district courtyard where he'd first seen her teaching children. The bakery owner, a stout woman with flour in her graying hair, gave him directions with obvious reluctance.

"She's down by the crystal gardens near the old mining district," the woman said, wiping her hands on her apron. "But Your Highness... might I suggest approaching carefully? The folk down there have been on edge since the tremors started. They're not exactly in a mood for..." she gestured vaguely at his royal colors.

Kaelith found the crystal gardens easily enough—a series of terraced plots where the mining families grew food using crystalline soil enhancement techniques. What he hadn't expected was the scene that greeted him: dozens of people working together to harvest and preserve crops against the possibility of evacuation, their movements coordinated by Zara's clear voice calling out instructions and encouragement.

She stood at the center of it all like a general commanding troops, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, her simple brown dress stained with dirt and crystal dust. But there was something magnificent about the way she moved, the easy authority with which she organized the evacuation preparations, the obvious trust and respect the others showed her.

*Look at her,* the voice whispered, and for once its tone wasn't entirely dismissive. *Playing at leadership while the real decisions are made by her betters. But imagine what she could accomplish under proper guidance. Imagine what she could become if she submitted to superior strength and wisdom.*

The thought sent an uncomfortable heat through Kaelith's chest. He'd been trying not to think about Zara in those terms, but the Lathe's influence made it difficult to separate desire from dominance, attraction from the need to possess.

"Your Highness." Her voice cut through his brooding as she approached, having spotted him watching from the garden's edge. Up close, he could see the exhaustion in her green eyes, the tension in her shoulders. She'd clearly been working since before dawn. "To what do we owe the honor?"

The formal politeness in her tone made his jaw clench. She was treating him like any other visiting noble, with exactly the minimum courtesy required by protocol and not an ounce more.

"I need your help," he said, the words scraping his throat like broken glass.

"Do you?" She tilted her head, studying his face with that unsettling directness. "That's... unexpected. What exactly do you need help with?"

"The volcanic crisis. The Harmony Crystal. I have reason to believe we can locate it, but I need someone with your... particular skills... to assist in the retrieval."

It was, he thought, a reasonable request presented in appropriately respectful terms. He was acknowledging her abilities, admitting he couldn't handle the situation alone, even offering her the chance to be part of something genuinely important.

So why was she looking at him as if he'd just insulted her?

"I see," she said slowly. "You need my 'particular skills' to assist you. As in, you're in charge, I follow orders, and we all hope your enhanced power doesn't cause another crystal explosion?"

*She's being deliberately obtuse,* the voice hissed. *She knows what you're offering her—the chance to be part of saving the kingdom. Her stubborn pride is blinding her to the honor you're doing her.*

"I'm offering you the opportunity to be part of the solution," Kaelith said, his patience beginning to fray. "This is bigger than whatever petty grievances exist between us."

"Petty grievances?" Zara's eyebrows rose. "Is that what we're calling it when you nearly killed half the royal court with your reckless showboating?"

"I was demonstrating advanced techniques that—"

"That you clearly don't understand well enough to control safely." She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a level that somehow carried more menace than shouting. "That artifact you're using, whatever it is, it's affecting your judgment. Making you think dominance and mastery are the same thing. Making you dangerous."

The accuracy of her words sent a spike of rage through him that was definitely not entirely his own. How dare she question his judgment? How dare she act as if she understood the complexities of ruling, the weight of responsibility, the necessity of making hard choices that others were too weak to make?

"What I'm using is power guided by wisdom and experience," he said coldly. "Something you might understand if you'd had proper training instead of learning peasant folk magic in back alleys."

Something shuttered in her expression, the concern replaced by icy disdain. "I see. So this is how it works—you need my help, but only if I accept that you're inherently superior and I'm just a useful tool."

"That's not what I—"

"Isn't it?" She crossed her arms, and he couldn't help noticing the way the gesture emphasized her figure, the defiant tilt of her chin that made him want to either shake her or kiss her until she admitted he was right. "You want me to serve you, Your Highness. To be a good little crystal-singer who follows orders and doesn't ask inconvenient questions about why your magic feels wrong."

*She wants to be dominated,* the voice whispered urgently. *She's testing your strength, seeing if you're worthy of her submission. Show her what real power looks like. Make her understand her proper place.*

The suggestion sent heat through his veins, and for a moment he found himself stepping closer to her, close enough to smell the crystal dust in her hair, close enough to see the way her pulse fluttered at the base of her throat. The air between them crackled with tension that was equal parts antagonism and attraction.

"What I want," he said, his voice low and dangerous, "is for you to stop being so stubborn and help me save the kingdom. What I want is for you to trust that I know what I'm doing and follow my lead. What I want..."

He trailed off, realizing that what he wanted was to back her against the nearest wall and prove through actions rather than words that he was worthy of her respect and desire and complete surrender.

Zara must have seen something of that in his expression because she took a deliberate step backward, her green eyes flashing with what looked like equal parts anger and disappointment.

"What you want is a servant, not a partner," she said quietly. "Someone who'll make you feel powerful and important without challenging your assumptions or questioning your methods. Well, Your Highness, I already have a job, and it's protecting these people from exactly the kind of disaster your pride is creating."

She gestured toward the families still working to secure their possessions against possible evacuation. "They don't need a ruler who sees cooperation as weakness and dominance as strength. They need someone who understands that real power comes from working together, not from forcing others to submit."

"And if your approach fails?" Kaelith demanded. "If gentle cooperation and harmonic balance aren't enough to stop an eruption that could destroy everything? What then?"

"Then we'll face that together, as equals, using every resource we have." Her voice was firm, absolute. "But we won't face it with me following you blindly while you make the same mistakes that got us into this mess."

The rejection hit him like a physical blow. She was turning down the chance to be part of something historic, choosing to cling to her principles rather than accept his leadership. Worse, she was doing it with that same pitying expression she'd worn after the courtyard disaster, as if he were a child throwing a tantrum rather than a prince offering alliance.

*You see?* the voice whispered triumphantly. *She doesn't respect you. She never will, as long as you keep approaching her as a supplicant. Take what you need. Show her that her cooperation isn't required—only her presence.*

For a moment, the suggestion was almost overwhelming. He could feel the Lathe's power singing in his blood, more than enough to overwhelm any resistance she might offer. He could take her with him to find the Harmony Crystal, and once she saw what he was capable of achieving, surely she would understand...

But the look in her eyes stopped him cold. Not fear—she would have fought him, and he knew she was powerful enough to make it costly—but disappointment so profound it made his chest ache.

"I see," he said stiffly. "Then I'll handle this without you."

"I hope you can," she replied, but her voice was soft now, almost sad. "I really do. Because if you can't, we're all going to pay the price for your pride."

He turned and walked away without another word, his shoulders rigid with wounded dignity and frustrated desire. Behind him, Zara watched until he disappeared from sight, one hand pressed unconsciously to her chest where an uncomfortable tightness had settled the moment he'd demonstrated his new abilities.

Around her, the evacuation preparations continued with quiet efficiency, but she could feel the weight of unspoken questions from her friends and neighbors. They'd trusted her judgment when she'd refused the prince's request, but what if she was wrong? What if his enhanced power really was their best hope of surviving what was coming?

*I hope you figure it out before it's too late,* she'd told him after the courtyard disaster. But looking at Mount Pyreth's smoking peak and feeling the increasingly violent tremors shaking the ground beneath their feet, she was beginning to fear that it already was.

Meanwhile, Kaelith made his way back to the palace with plans forming in his mind—plans that didn't require anyone's cooperation or approval. He would find the Harmony Crystal himself, use the Lathe's power to control it, and save the kingdom through strength of will alone. And when it was over, when everyone saw what he had accomplished, perhaps a certain crystal-singer would finally understand what she had turned away.

The voice in his head purred with satisfaction. Everything was proceeding exactly as it should.
