# Chapter 4: Tremors of Warning

The earthquake struck during the night, rolling through the palace foundations with the deep rumble of a waking giant. Prince Kaelith felt it as a discordant vibration in the crystals that lined his chamber walls—a tremor that spoke of forces far beneath the earth stirring to violent life. But instead of alarm, he felt only annoyance at being disturbed from dreams that had been particularly vivid.

Dreams of green eyes flashing with defiance. Of auburn hair catching fire as crystal magic danced around it. Of a voice raised not in submission but in challenge, demanding that he prove himself worthy rather than simply accepting his superiority.

Zara. Even three days after their explosive confrontation in the courtyard, her presence haunted his thoughts like a fever that refused to break.

The Lathe of Light rested on the table beside his bed, its three spindles glowing faintly in response to the seismic disturbance. The artifact's whispers had grown more insistent since the demonstration, painting visions of dominance and control that centered increasingly on the crystal-singer who had dared to humiliate him in public. She had power—raw, undisciplined, but undeniably potent—and the Lathe promised that such strength belonged by his side.

Another tremor shook the palace, stronger this time, causing the crystal formations on his walls to sing with harmonics that bordered on painful. Through his enhanced senses, Kaelith could feel the disturbance propagating outward from the east, where Mount Pyreth had slumbered for five centuries. But such concerns seemed distant compared to the images that filled his mind.

How had she moved with such grace during their battle? How had her voice commanded the crystals without any artificial enhancement? And why, despite her obvious lack of formal training, had her technique felt so... complete?

A sharp knock interrupted his brooding. "Your Highness," came Captain Thorne's voice, tight with urgency. "Your father requests your immediate presence in the war room. We have reports from the eastern provinces."

Kaelith rose reluctantly, pulling on his silk robe and securing the Lathe at his side. The artifact's weight had become comforting, a constant reminder of the power that set him apart from ordinary men. "What manner of reports could require such urgency at this hour?"

"Seismic activity, Your Highness. The tremors we've been feeling originated from Mount Pyreth. The eastern settlements are reporting significant damage."

The words penetrated Kaelith's distraction like cold water. He had felt the tremors, certainly, but he hadn't considered their implications beyond the inconvenience to his rest. "How significant?"

"Several buildings collapsed in Eastport. The crystal mines report cave-ins on three separate levels. And the temperature readings from the volcanic monitoring stations..." Captain Thorne's voice trailed off, clearly troubled. "Your father wishes to discuss evacuation procedures."

Evacuation. The word should have filled Kaelith with urgency, but instead he found his mind drifting back to Malachar's earlier reports. The eastern provinces—where Zara had supposedly been seen demonstrating her abilities to grateful common folk. If evacuation became necessary, would she flee with the rest? Or would her stubborn pride keep her close to the danger, trying to help others escape?

The image of her in peril sent an unexpected spike of possessive fury through his chest. The Lathe responded to his emotional surge, its whispers turning seductive—he could save her, protect her, prove his worth through heroic action. She would have no choice but to acknowledge his superiority then.

"Your Highness?" Captain Thorne's voice carried a note of concern. "Shall I tell the king you're coming?"

"Yes," Kaelith replied, though his attention remained divided. "I'll be there shortly."

The war room occupied the lowest level of the palace, its walls lined with maps and communication crystals that allowed real-time contact with distant provinces. King Aldren stood before a massive relief map of the kingdom, his silver hair disheveled and his face etched with worry lines that seemed to have deepened overnight. Around him, a dozen advisors and generals spoke in urgent whispers, their voices creating a buzz of barely controlled panic.

"Ah, Kaelith," the king said as his son entered. "Come, see what our monitoring stations have reported."

The map was marked with red crystals that indicated seismic activity, and Kaelith was shocked to see how many had been placed around Mount Pyreth. The mountain itself glowed with a pulsing orange light that spoke of magma stirring deep beneath its slopes.

"The tremors began six hours ago," explained Master Geologis, the kingdom's chief earth-reader, his face pale with exhaustion. "They're increasing in both frequency and magnitude. The thermal readings suggest massive movement in the deep magma chambers—something we haven't seen since the last eruption five centuries ago."

King Aldren pointed to several settlements marked on the map's eastern edge. "Eastport, Crystalbrook, and the entire Valley of Singing Stones are at immediate risk if the mountain erupts. We're looking at potential casualties in the tens of thousands."

The magnitude of the crisis should have focused Kaelith's attention completely, but instead he found himself studying the map for different reasons. Which of those settlements had Zara been visiting? Where might she be now, possibly trapped by rock falls or advancing towards even greater danger?

"We need to begin immediate evacuations," Lord Commander Reyes declared, his gruff voice cutting through the murmured discussions. "Every hour we delay increases the risk."

"And where exactly do you propose we evacuate them to?" demanded Councilor Aldric, his politician's instincts already calculating costs. "The logistics alone—housing, feeding, protecting tens of thousands of refugees..."

As the debate intensified around him, Kaelith felt the Lathe of Light pulsing with increasing urgency. The artifact's whispers painted visions of heroic rescue, of using his enhanced abilities to save not just the kingdom but the crystal-singer whose defiance had captured his obsessive attention. He could seek her out, protect her personally, prove that his power served a greater purpose than mere demonstration.

"What about the Harmony Crystal?" he interrupted, causing the heated discussion to falter. "If such a device truly exists, it could redirect the volcanic forces rather than simply fleeing from them."

Master Elyrian, who had remained silent in the corner of the room, stepped forward with deeply troubled features. "Your Highness, we've discussed this before. The references to such crystals are fragmentary at best, myths that may have no basis in—"

"Then why do the ancient texts speak of them at all?" Kaelith demanded, his hand instinctively moving to the Lathe. "Why would our ancestors waste time recording lies about crystals that could command natural disasters?"

King Aldren looked between his son and his advisors, hope and skepticism warring in his expression. "Even if such a crystal exists, Kaelith, finding it could take months we don't have. The mountain won't wait for archaeological expeditions."

"I don't need months," Kaelith replied, the Lathe's whispers filling his mind with confidence that bordered on arrogance. "With enhanced crystal magic, I can locate resonance patterns that would be invisible to conventional techniques. The Harmony Crystal will call to me if I'm close enough to hear it."

The claim was bold to the point of recklessness, but the artifact's influence made it feel like inevitable truth. More importantly, such a quest would require traveling to the eastern provinces—exactly where Zara was rumored to be. He could pursue two objectives simultaneously: saving the kingdom and claiming the crystal-singer whose power belonged with his.

Another tremor shook the palace, stronger than any before, causing the communication crystals to flicker with unstable harmonics. Several of the advisors grabbed the table for support as the floor bucked beneath their feet.

"By the ancestors," breathed Master Geologis, his face going white as he consulted the readings from his instruments. "The deep chambers are destabilizing faster than our models predicted. We may have days, not weeks."

The news sent a fresh wave of panic through the assembled advisors, but Kaelith felt only excitement. If time was running short, he would need to act immediately—and alone. The crystal-singer's abilities would be crucial to locating the Harmony Crystal quickly enough to matter.

"Father," he said, his voice carrying new authority as the Lathe's power resonated through his words. "Give me permission to travel east immediately. I can locate the Harmony Crystal and evacuate threatened settlements simultaneously. Two objectives served by a single mission."

King Aldren studied his son's face, clearly torn between paternal concern and desperate hope. "Kaelith, if Mount Pyreth erupts while you're in the eastern provinces..."

"Then I'll be in the perfect position to use the Harmony Crystal to redirect the lava flows," Kaelith finished confidently. "The ancient texts speak of such crystals being most effective when wielded close to the geological disturbance they're meant to control."

It was a reasonable-sounding argument, though in truth he had no idea whether proximity mattered for legendary artifacts. The Lathe whispered encouragement, painting visions of triumph that conveniently included a grateful crystal-singer recognizing his superior abilities.

Lord Commander Reyes stepped forward, his weathered face creased with concern. "Your Highness, if you're determined to pursue this course, at least take a full escort. The eastern roads may be blocked by rockslides, and if you encounter hostile forces—"

"I'll travel faster alone," Kaelith cut him off, already planning how to seek out Zara without the complication of royal guards reporting his every action. "Enhanced crystal magic can clear blocked roads and provide protection far more efficiently than conventional escorts."

The claim was boastful but not entirely false—the Lathe's power could indeed accomplish feats that would challenge entire companies of soldiers. But his real motivation had nothing to do with practical efficiency and everything to do with the obsession that grew stronger with each passing hour.

Another tremor struck, this one accompanied by a distant rumbling that seemed to come from the very bones of the earth. In the communication crystals, they could see flickers of orange light—thermal blooms from deep within Mount Pyreth that spoke of rising magma.

"Very well," King Aldren said finally, his voice heavy with reluctant acceptance. "But promise me you'll prioritize your own safety. A dead hero saves no one."

Kaelith bowed formally, though his mind was already racing ahead to the journey that would reunite him with the crystal-singer whose defiance had become an itch he couldn't scratch. "I give you my word, Father. I'll return with the solution to our crisis."

As the war room erupted in discussions of evacuation routes and supply lines, Kaelith quietly slipped away to prepare for his departure. The Lathe of Light pulsed with satisfaction, its whispers painting increasingly detailed visions of triumph—not just over the volcanic threat, but over the proud woman whose power would soon serve his greater purpose.

By dawn, he would be riding east toward danger and destiny. Toward the crystal-singer who didn't yet realize she belonged to him.

The artifact hummed with dark anticipation, its corruption spreading deeper into his heart with every beat.

But in the depths of Mount Pyreth, forces older than kingdoms or princes stirred toward wakefulness. The mountain had slumbered for five centuries, but its patience was not infinite. Soon, very soon, it would remind the world what true power looked like.

And when that moment came, neither crystal lathes nor crystal-singers might be enough to contain the fury that had been building in darkness for half a millennium.

The tremors continued through the night, growing stronger with each passing hour, as if the earth itself was warning of catastrophe to come.
