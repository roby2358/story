# Chapter 5: The Uncle's Gambit

The arrival of Lord Malachar Starweaver was announced with considerably more ceremony than the seismic tremors had warranted. Trumpets sounded from the watchtowers as his retinue approached through the dawn mist—a disciplined column of crystal warriors in dark armor, their movements precise and intimidating. At their head rode the prince's uncle, tall and imposing on a black destrier, his prematurely gray hair catching the morning light like spun silver.

Kaelith watched the procession from his study window, noting the way the common folk stepped back to let the column pass. There was no warmth in their faces as there had been for his father's homecomings, no spontaneous cheering or tossed flowers. Malachar inspired respect, certainly, but it was the cold respect given to a blade's edge—useful, necessary, and potentially lethal.

*Interesting timing,* the voice murmured as Kaelith observed his uncle's approach. *The mountain stirs, and he appears. Some might call that convenient.*

"My lord," a servant announced from the doorway, "Lord Malachar requests an audience at your earliest convenience."

Kaelith turned from the window, noting the careful phrasing. In the royal court, such requests were rarely genuine—they were polite demands wrapped in diplomatic silk. "Tell my uncle I'll receive him in the throne room within the hour."

But Malachar didn't wait for formal protocols. He appeared in Kaelith's study barely twenty minutes later, having apparently bypassed the servants entirely. The older man moved with the fluid grace of someone who had spent decades honing both political and magical skills, his amber eyes taking in every detail of the room with predatory interest.

"Nephew," he said, his voice warm with what seemed like genuine affection. "You've grown since I last saw you. Stronger. More... substantial."

There was something in the way he said 'substantial' that made Kaelith's skin crawl, as if his uncle could see the Lathe's influence radiating from him like heat from a forge. "Uncle. Your timing is fortuitous—we could use experienced counsel regarding the seismic disturbances."

"Ah yes, the tremors." Malachar moved to the window, gazing out at Mount Pyreth with the expression of a man studying a chess board. "Concerning, certainly. Though I confess myself curious about other recent... disturbances."

"Such as?"

His uncle's smile was sharp as a blade. "The rather spectacular demonstration you gave in the Royal Courtyard, for instance. The reports I received were quite... vivid. Apparently you've made some remarkable advances in crystal artistry."

*He knows something,* the voice whispered urgently. *Be careful.*

"I've been exploring new techniques," Kaelith said carefully. "The traditional methods seemed... limiting."

"Indeed they do." Malachar turned from the window, his amber eyes fixed on his nephew's face with uncomfortable intensity. "Traditional methods. Traditional thinking. Traditional constraints on what's possible for someone with true vision."

The words sent a chill down Kaelith's spine. They echoed too closely the thoughts that had been forming in his own mind, the justifications he'd been building for his increasing disregard of conventional wisdom.

"You speak as if you've experienced such limitations yourself," Kaelith said.

"Oh, I have. For years, I watched your father rule with admirable caution and traditional restraint. Safe choices. Predictable outcomes. No real innovation or progress." Malachar's voice carried just the faintest hint of contempt. "Of course, that was before the mountain began to wake."

Another tremor chose that moment to roll through the palace, stronger than the previous ones. Crystal ornaments chimed in their settings, and somewhere in the distance, Kaelith could hear the concerned voices of servants. His uncle, however, didn't even flinch.

"You felt that coming," Kaelith observed.

"Experience teaches one to read the signs. The question is, what does our future king intend to do about it?"

The challenge in those words was unmistakable. Kaelith felt the Lathe's power stirring in response, feeding on his need to prove himself worthy of respect. "I intend to handle it."

"Alone?"

"If necessary."

"Admirable confidence." Malachar moved closer, his presence somehow both reassuring and threatening. "Though I can't help but wonder... what resources are you drawing upon for such certainty? Surely not the conventional approaches taught by the academy?"

*He's fishing,* the voice warned. *He suspects about the Lathe but doesn't know for certain. Don't give him anything.*

"I've been studying the old texts," Kaelith said, which was technically true. "There are techniques mentioned in the ancient archives that go beyond what's typically taught."

"Ah, the archives. Yes, I've spent considerable time there myself over the years. Fascinating reading, though much of it is... incomplete. So many gaps in the historical record, so many references to artifacts and methods that were apparently lost during various catastrophes." His uncle's smile was knowing. "Of course, sometimes what's lost isn't really lost at all. Sometimes it's simply... waiting for the right person to find it."

The words hung in the air between them like a challenge. Kaelith found himself torn between the desire to confide in someone who seemed to understand his ambitions and the growing certainty that doing so would be a catastrophic mistake.

"The archives are indeed illuminating," he said finally.

"I'm sure they are." Malachar stepped back, apparently satisfied with whatever he'd learned from the exchange. "Well, I've taken enough of your time with idle conversation. I should pay my respects to the court and settle my men. But perhaps we might continue this discussion later? I have some thoughts about unconventional approaches to seismic management that might interest you."

After his uncle left, Kaelith stood alone in his study, feeling as if he'd just participated in a conversation with multiple hidden meanings. The Lathe's whispers had grown louder during Malachar's visit, more insistent, as if the artifact sensed a potential threat to its influence.

*He's dangerous,* the voice murmured. *He wants what you have. He'll try to undermine your authority, make you look weak in front of the court.*

But there had been something else in his uncle's manner—a recognition, perhaps even approval, of the power Kaelith had gained. Unlike Master Elyrian's disappointment or Zara's concerned criticism, Malachar seemed to understand that strength sometimes required bending or breaking conventional rules.

A soft knock interrupted his thoughts. "Enter," he called, expecting another servant with court business.

Instead, Master Elyrian stepped through the doorway, his crystal-topped staff clicking against the marble floor. The elderly instructor looked haggard, as if he hadn't slept well in days.

"My lord," he said formally. "I wanted to speak with you about the seismic activity."

"Everyone wants to speak to me about the seismic activity," Kaelith replied, not bothering to hide his irritation. "Can't the kingdom's experts handle geological surveys without involving the crown prince?"

"Under normal circumstances, yes. But these circumstances are far from normal." Master Elyrian moved closer, his brown eyes grave with concern. "The harmonic patterns I've been monitoring suggest something more than simple volcanic activity. There are... resonances... that seem artificial in origin."

"Artificial how?"

"As if something is amplifying the natural instabilities. Something with considerable power and very little regard for the consequences of its actions."

The accusation in those words was barely veiled. Kaelith felt his temper flare, fed by the Lathe's influence and his growing exhaustion with everyone's attempts to question his judgment.

"Are you suggesting that I'm somehow responsible for geological forces beyond any mortal control?"

"I'm suggesting that power without wisdom can have far-reaching consequences, my lord. And I'm hoping that you'll trust me enough to explain where your new abilities are truly coming from."

*He knows,* the voice whispered urgently. *He's always been too perceptive, too suspicious. He'll try to turn others against you.*

"My abilities come from study and natural talent," Kaelith said coldly. "Perhaps if you spent less time speculating about harmonic resonances and more time preparing practical solutions, the kingdom would be better served."

Pain flickered across Master Elyrian's weathered features. "My lord, I've served your family for forty years. I taught you your first crystal exercises when you were seven years old. Please—whatever you've found, whatever promises it's making, consider the possibility that some kinds of power aren't worth their price."

"I think this conversation is over."

The old man stood there for a long moment, his staff trembling slightly in his gnarled hands. When he spoke again, his voice was soft with something that sounded like grief.

"I see. Then I must do what I should have done years ago, when I was young and thought I knew better." He turned toward the door, pausing only to add, "I'm sorry, my lord. For all of it."

After Master Elyrian left, Kaelith found himself alone with his thoughts and the growing conviction that everyone around him was either too weak to understand what needed to be done or too jealous to support him in doing it. Even the people who claimed to care about him seemed more interested in limiting his potential than helping him achieve it.

*You see how they turn against you?* the voice whispered. *First they challenge your techniques, then they question your judgment, and finally they threaten to interfere with your destiny. But you don't need them. You have power beyond their comprehension.*

That night, he returned to the ruins with a sense of purpose that felt almost like coming home. The Lathe waited for him in its crystal chamber, pulsing with welcome and the promise of understanding. When he touched its surface, the familiar rush of power came accompanied by visions that were clearer and more detailed than ever before.

He saw the volcanic pressure building in precise mathematical terms—temperature gradients, pressure differentials, the exact timing of when the eruption would begin. But more importantly, he saw how his enhanced abilities could redirect those forces, channel them safely away from populated areas through crystalline conduits that would turn destructive energy into something useful.

It would require more power than any conventional crystal user could muster. It would mean abandoning the collaborative approaches that traditionalists favored in favor of pure, decisive action. But it was possible—not just possible, but inevitable, if he had the courage to claim his full potential.

*This is why you were chosen,* the voice whispered as the visions faded. *This is why the Lathe revealed itself to you. The kingdom needs a ruler who can make the hard choices, who can act decisively when others hesitate.*

When Kaelith finally climbed back to the palace, dawn was breaking over Mount Pyreth, and the mountain's peak was wreathed in smoke that hadn't been there the day before. Time was running short, and he had work to do.

But as he made his way through the quiet corridors, he didn't notice the shadow that detached itself from an alcove and followed at a discrete distance. Lord Malachar had spent the night observing, learning, confirming suspicions that had been growing for days.

His nephew had found something in the ruins. Something powerful enough to enhance his abilities and corrupt his judgment in exactly the ways Malachar had hoped for. The boy was becoming everything his uncle needed him to be—proud, isolated, desperate to prove himself through displays of individual strength.

Soon, very soon, Prince Kaelith would make the kind of catastrophic mistake that would give Malachar everything he'd ever wanted. And when that happened, the kingdom would need a new ruler—someone with the experience and wisdom to guide them through the crisis that was coming.

Someone like Lord Malachar Starweaver, who had been preparing for this moment for twenty years.
