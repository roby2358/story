# Chapter 2: The Lathe Awakens

The crystal staircase descended far deeper than Kaelith had expected, winding through chambers carved from living stone that hummed with residual magic. Ancient glyphs covered the walls, their meanings lost to time but their power still palpable in the way they made his skin tingle. Emergency lanterns of his own making—simple light crystals floating at shoulder height—barely penetrated the shadows that seemed to move of their own accord.

"This can't be possible," he murmured, running his fingers along a particularly intricate carving. "The palace is only three hundred years old. These ruins must be..."

Ancient. The word echoed in the silence like a whisper from the stones themselves.

He found it in the deepest chamber, resting on a pedestal of black crystal that reflected no light. The Lathe of Light was beautiful in a way that made his breath catch—a sculpture of pure, crystallized starlight shaped into flowing, organic curves that seemed to shift and change when he wasn't looking directly at it. It was the size of a small harp, but instead of strings, delicate filaments of solidified light stretched between its frame, creating patterns that hurt to look at too closely.

The moment Kaelith's fingers touched its surface, the world exploded into sensation.

Power flooded through him like molten metal in his veins, raw and intoxicating and more than he'd ever dreamed possible. Every crystal within a hundred yards began to sing in perfect harmony, their voices joining in a symphony that made the air itself dance with light. He could feel every gem in the palace above, every shard of quartz in the mountain below, every fragment of crystal scattered across the kingdom.

He could command them all.

*Yes,* whispered a voice that might have been his own thoughts or might have been something else entirely. *This is what true mastery feels like. This is what you were meant to be.*

When he finally released the artifact and stumbled backward, his hands were shaking and his eyes were streaming tears of joy. The Lathe settled back onto its pedestal as if it had never moved, but Kaelith could still feel its presence like a warm coal in his chest.

He climbed the crystal stairs in a daze, emerging into morning sunlight that seemed dimmer than it had before. The entrance sealed itself behind him, but he barely noticed. He was already planning what he would do with his newfound power, already imagining the looks on people's faces when they saw what he could achieve.

Especially her. The crystal-singer with the flame-colored hair and the insufferable confidence. He would show her what real mastery looked like.

"My lord?" The voice made him jump. Master Elyrian stood at the edge of the Crystal Gardens, his elderly frame supported by a walking stick topped with a simple clear quartz. "I felt... disruption in the crystal harmonics. Are you well?"

Kaelith's mentor was seventy-seven years old and had taught crystal arts at the royal academy for longer than Kaelith had been alive. His white hair and gentle brown eyes had witnessed more magical anomalies than anyone else in the kingdom, which made him both invaluable as a teacher and annoyingly perceptive as an observer.

"I'm fine, Master Elyrian," Kaelith said, struggling to keep the excitement out of his voice. "Just practicing."

The old man's eyes narrowed as he studied his former student. "Practicing what, exactly? The resonance I felt was unlike anything you've produced before."

"Perhaps I'm finally living up to my potential."

"Hmm." Master Elyrian stepped closer, and Kaelith had to resist the urge to back away. Those brown eyes seemed to see right through him. "True mastery comes not from bending crystals to your will, but from understanding the harmony between power and responsibility, my lord. The greatest crystal artists in history were those who knew when not to use their abilities, not those who could command the most."

*Outdated fool,* the voice whispered in the back of Kaelith's mind. *What does he know about true power? About what you could become?*

"With respect, Master," Kaelith said, his tone cooler than he'd intended, "I think I'm beyond such elementary lessons."

Pain flickered across the old man's face, quickly masked. "Of course, my lord. Forgive an old teacher's rambling." He bowed stiffly and began to walk away, his crystal-topped staff clicking against the marble.

Kaelith watched him go, part of him wanting to call out, to apologize, to ask about the wisdom in those words that seemed important somehow. But the warmth in his chest pulsed, and the moment passed.

He had more important things to do than coddle an aging instructor's feelings.

Finding the crystal-singer proved easier than expected. She was in the lower districts, of course, in a small courtyard behind a bakery where a group of village children sat in a circle around her. Kaelith watched from the shadows as she taught them to coax light from simple quartz pebbles—the kind of basic exercise he'd mastered when he was eight years old.

But there was something about the way she moved, the gentle authority in her voice, the genuine delight on the children's faces when their crystals responded to her guidance. She treated each small success as if it were a miracle, celebrated each fumbling attempt as if it mattered.

"That's it, Mira," she said to a girl who couldn't have been more than ten. "Don't force it. Ask the crystal nicely. Tell it what you need."

The little girl's face scrunched in concentration, and her bit of quartz flickered with the faintest hint of light. The other children cheered, and the crystal-singer—Zara, he'd learned her name by now—grinned as if the child had just split the moon in half.

"Beautiful," she said. "Absolutely beautiful."

*She's playing in the shallows,* the voice whispered. *Show her what the deep waters look like.*

Kaelith stepped into the courtyard. "Impressive," he said, making sure his voice carried the proper amount of aristocratic amusement. "Though perhaps a bit elementary for someone who claims to know about true mastery."

The children looked up at him with wide eyes, recognizing the royal colors even if they didn't know his face. But Zara didn't bow or curtsy or show any of the deference he was accustomed to. She simply stood, brushing dust from her brown skirt, and fixed him with those impossibly green eyes.

"Your Highness," she said, her tone politely neutral. "To what do we owe the honor?"

"I thought you might like to see what crystal work looks like when it's not limited by... conventional thinking."

He reached into his pouch and withdrew three of the crystal shards from this morning's experiment. They were small and damaged, hardly impressive under normal circumstances. But as the Lathe's power flowed through him, they began to glow like captive stars.

The children gasped as the shards rose into the air, spinning faster and faster until they blurred into rings of pure light. Kaelith built a complex harmonic structure around them, layering melody upon melody until the air itself sang with power. It was everything he'd been trying to achieve this morning and more—a display of technical mastery that should have left any observer speechless with awe.

When he finally let the crystals settle back into his palm, the silence stretched for several heartbeats. The children stared at him with something approaching worship.

Zara, however, was frowning.

"That was certainly... energetic," she said slowly. "But tell me, Your Highness—what did you accomplish with all that power?"

"I demonstrated superior technique," he said, confused by her reaction. "I showed these children what's possible when someone truly understands crystal arts."

"You showed them a light show," she corrected. "Beautiful, yes. Technically impressive, certainly. But what did it create? What problem did it solve? What harmony did it add to the world?"

*She doesn't understand,* the voice whispered. *She's too limited to appreciate what you've achieved.*

"Not everything needs a practical purpose," Kaelith said, his irritation growing. "Sometimes mastery is its own reward."

"Is it?" Zara knelt and picked up a handful of dirt from the courtyard, ordinary brown earth that probably hadn't seen rain in weeks. She began to hum again, that same low melody from the garden, and Kaelith felt his breath catch as tiny crystals began to form in the soil—microscopic at first, then growing into delicate formations that captured moisture from the air and began to glow with soft, steady light.

"Water crystals," she said simply. "They'll keep the bakery's garden watered for a month, even in drought. The light will help the vegetables grow even in the shade." She stood and brushed the dirt from her hands. "That's what I call mastery, Your Highness. Power that serves life, not just ego."

The children gathered around the newly formed crystals with wonder, their faces illuminated by the gentle glow. They reached out to touch them with reverent fingers, and Kaelith realized with a sick twist in his stomach that they were looking at Zara's simple, practical magic with the same awe they'd shown for his flashy display—maybe more.

*She's trying to diminish you,* the voice whispered, and this time it sounded angry. *She's jealous of your power and wants to make you doubt yourself. Don't let her.*

"Anyone can make useful trinkets," he said, his voice sharper than he'd intended. "I'm talking about true artistry. About pushing the boundaries of what's possible."

Zara studied him for a long moment, and he had the uncomfortable feeling she was seeing something he didn't want her to see. "The crystals you're using," she said quietly. "They're singing wrong."

"What?"

"Their harmonics are... off. Artificial. Like someone is forcing them to sing in a key that isn't natural to them." Her green eyes met his, and he saw concern there, not mockery. "Where did that power come from, Your Highness? What changed since this morning?"

For a moment, Kaelith wavered. There was something in her voice, in her expression, that made him want to tell her everything. About the ruins, about the Lathe, about the intoxicating rush of power that was still singing in his veins. She would understand, wouldn't she? She was a crystal-singer. She would know what it meant to touch something that ancient and powerful.

*Don't,* the voice whispered urgently. *She'll try to take it from you. She'll say you're not worthy. Keep the power to yourself.*

"My power comes from years of study and natural talent," he said stiffly. "Perhaps if you'd had proper training instead of learning... folk techniques... you'd understand the difference."

Something shuttered in her expression. The concern was replaced by polite distance, and somehow that hurt worse than her earlier mockery.

"Of course, Your Highness," she said. "Forgive my presumption."

She turned back to the children, dismissing him as thoroughly as if he'd never been there. "Come on, little ones. Let's see if we can teach these crystals to sing a lullaby for when the sun goes down."

Kaelith stood there for another moment, watching her work with the children, watching them respond to her natural authority and genuine care. Part of him wanted to stay, to apologize, to ask her to explain what she'd meant about artificial harmonics.

But the warmth in his chest pulsed again, and the moment passed.

He turned and walked away, telling himself he'd proven his point. She was talented, yes, but limited by her common background and lack of proper training. With the Lathe's power, he would show everyone—including her—what true mastery really looked like.

Behind him, Zara watched him go, her hand pressed unconsciously to her chest where an uncomfortable tension had settled the moment he'd demonstrated his new abilities. The crystals around her seemed restless, their songs slightly out of tune, as if something had disturbed the natural order of things.

"Miss Zara?" little Mira tugged on her skirt. "Why did the prince's crystals sound sad?"

Zara looked down at the child's honest face and felt a chill that had nothing to do with the afternoon shadows. "I don't know, sweetheart," she said quietly. "But I think we're going to find out."
