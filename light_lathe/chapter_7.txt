# Chapter 7: Into the Unknown

The workshop fell silent as every crystal-singer in the room turned to stare at their prince. Zara straightened slowly from the relief supplies she had been organizing, her green eyes reflecting a fire that had nothing to do with the volcanic glow painting the windows crimson. Around her, a dozen of her people—miners, artisans, street performers—formed an unconscious barrier between their leader and the royal intruder who had just announced his expectations with all the subtlety of a hammer blow.

"Services," she repeated, her voice carrying a dangerous calm that made the workshop's crystals hum with tension. "I see. And what exactly does His Royal Highness believe I owe him?"

Kaelith stepped further into the workshop, his enhanced presence making the air itself shimmer with barely-contained power. The Lathe of Light thrummed with satisfaction at his display of authority, whispering reassurances about natural hierarchy and proper respect. Surely now she would recognize the magnitude of the crisis and submit to his leadership.

"The kingdom faces destruction," he said, his voice carrying harmonics that had been crafted to inspire awe and immediate compliance. "Ancient texts speak of a legendary artifact that might redirect the volcanic flows. I require someone with... adequate... crystal sensitivity to assist in its location."

"*Adequate.*" The word emerged from Zara's lips like a curse, and several of her companions shifted with the fluid grace of people preparing for violence. "How generous of you to acknowledge that my crude common techniques might prove... adequate... for your desperate need."

The mockery in her voice hit him like a physical blow. This wasn't how the conversation was supposed to proceed. He was offering her the chance to serve her kingdom, to participate in a quest of legendary significance, to work alongside enhanced royal power that could reshape reality itself. Her response should have been gratitude, not this bitter defiance.

"I am attempting," he said with strained patience, "to organize a mission that will save hundreds of thousands of lives. Personal grievances seem remarkably petty in the face of such stakes."

"Personal grievances?" Zara moved with that liquid grace he remembered from their first encounter, but now it held undertones of predatory danger. "You humiliate me before the entire court, dismiss my warnings about the corruption of your artifact, and now you want me to drop everything and serve your ego while you play hero?"

"I want," Kaelith said, his enhanced power beginning to leak into his voice in ways that made the workshop's walls tremble, "your assistance in saving our people from annihilation."

"Then *ask* for it." The words cracked like a whip across the workshop's tense atmosphere. "Don't demand it. Don't command it. Don't treat me like a tool to be picked up when convenient and discarded when your pride has been satisfied. *Ask.*"

The simple word hung between them like a chasm neither could cross. For Kaelith to ask would be to acknowledge her as an equal, to admit that his enhanced abilities might require collaborative support, to humble himself before someone whose crude techniques had publicly exposed his artificial mastery. The Lathe of Light's whispers painted such humility as weakness that would undermine his authority and endanger the mission itself.

"I am the crown prince of Crystallumina," he said with cold finality. "I do not *ask* for what I can rightfully command."

"Then command someone else." Zara turned her back on him with deliberate dismissal, returning to her relief work as if he had ceased to exist. "I've got people to help who actually need what I can offer, rather than someone who wants to use my abilities to validate his own superiority."

The rejection hit him like molten steel. Around the workshop, her companions watched with expressions that mixed sympathy for their leader with genuine shock at witnessing someone refuse royal authority so completely. This was unprecedented, unthinkable, a violation of social order that struck at the foundation of everything he had been taught about power and hierarchy.

"You're condemning the kingdom to death," he said, his voice carrying harmonics of genuine anguish beneath the enhanced authority. "Whatever personal animosity exists between us, surely our people deserve—"

"Our people deserve a leader who listens to advisors instead of artifacts," Zara interrupted without turning around. "They deserve someone who builds partnerships instead of demanding submission. They deserve someone who understands that true strength comes from harmony, not dominance."

Each word was precisely chosen to expose the contradictions in his position. How could someone who had systematically alienated every potential ally hope to succeed in a quest that ancient texts suggested required exceptional cooperation? How could enhanced individual power accomplish what collaborative wisdom might achieve through unity?

But pride, once wounded, becomes a force more destructive than any volcano. The Lathe of Light's whispers took on urgent intensity, painting her refusal as proof that common blood could never truly comprehend the burdens of noble responsibility. She was beneath him, unworthy of his consideration, incapable of understanding the magnitude of what he offered.

"Then I will save the kingdom without you," Kaelith said with crystalline finality. "When the Harmony Crystal redirects Mount Pyreth's fury and our people sing songs of royal heroism, remember that you chose petty resentment over service to something greater than yourself."

He turned to leave, then paused at the workshop door for one final demonstration of the power she had rejected. With a gesture that should have inspired awe, he made every crystal in the room sing in perfect mathematical harmony—a display of enhanced mastery that showcased exactly what she was refusing to support.

But instead of the complex beauty he intended, the crystals produced only a cold, mechanical resonance that made her people wince with sympathetic pain. The harmony was technically perfect and utterly soulless, a demonstration that proved her point about the difference between commanding and partnering more effectively than any argument could have achieved.

Zara's voice followed him into the crimson-tinged night as he stalked away from the workshop: "When that artifact destroys everything you thought you were fighting to save, remember that someone tried to warn you. Remember that there was another way."

But Kaelith was already beyond hearing anything except the Lathe of Light's whispers about destiny and superiority and the inevitable triumph of enhanced power over crude natural talent. The crystal-singer's rejection had only proven what the artifact had been telling him all along—that others were too limited, too weak, too common to understand what true mastery required.

He would find the Harmony Crystal alone. He would save the kingdom through individual brilliance that owed nothing to collaborative weakness. And when he returned victorious, every person who had doubted him would understand the fundamental difference between royal blood and common limitations.

An hour before dawn, Prince Kaelith Starweaver stood at the entrance to the Crystalline Depths—networks of crystal caves that extended deep into Mount Pyreth's heart, formed by the interaction of geological pressure and raw magical forces. The volcanic glow from above painted the cave mouth in shades of orange and gold, while from within came the whispered songs of crystals that had been growing in darkness for millennia.

The ancient texts had warned of trials that tested worthiness, of guardians that challenged intentions, of mazes that shifted according to the seeker's heart. But enhanced power made such warnings seem quaint rather than concerning. Whatever lay ahead, he possessed abilities that transcended the limitations that had defeated previous seekers.

The Lathe of Light pulsed with anticipation as he stepped into the darkness, its spiraling crystal segments beginning to glow with inner fire that banished shadows and revealed passages carved from living gemstone. Each step deeper into the mountain's heart made his enhanced power grow stronger, as if proximity to the earth's molten core fed the artifact's hunger for raw force.

Behind him, the workshop where he had demanded submission rather than requesting partnership continued its work of helping common people survive an uncommon crisis. Ahead lay trials that would test everything he believed about power, mastery, and the price of pride.

And in the deepest chambers of the mountain's heart, something that had been waiting for centuries began to stir with recognition. The Harmony Crystal felt the approach of someone seeking its power, and in the resonance of his enhanced abilities, it heard both the potential for salvation and the seeds of ultimate catastrophe.

The quest had begun. But as Prince Kaelith Starweaver descended into darkness lit only by artificial enhancement, he had no idea that every step deeper into the mountain was also a step away from the humanity that might have made him worthy of what he sought.

Some bridges, once burned, could never be rebuilt. And some choices, once made, led to destinations that no amount of power could help one escape.
