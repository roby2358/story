The world of Crystallumina is one of strange powers, intrigue, mystical beings, and compelling characters caught up in grand dramas. The magic of the world flows exclusively through wonderous crystals, shaping the world on a meta level. It's as if the power, drama, and tension of the world is itself a crystal, as if the story is viewed through a crystalized lens. The events of Cyristallumina are momentous while also made small by contrast with all the other momentous events. At the heart of it all, the crystals work their magic. But are the people of Crystallumina working magic through the crystals, or are the crystals working their magic through them?
